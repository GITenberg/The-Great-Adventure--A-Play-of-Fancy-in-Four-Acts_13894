<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<br />


<p><i>Front room on ground floor at 126 Redcliffe Gardens. An
apartment furnished richly but in an old-fashioned way. Fine
pictures. Large furniture. Sofa near centre. General air of neglect
and dustiness. Carpet half-laid. Trunks and bags lying about in
corners, some opened. Men's wearing apparel exposed.
Mantelpiece</i>, R., <i>in disorder. At back double doors (ajar)
leading to another room. Door</i>, L., <i>leading to hall and front
door.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Time</span>.&mdash;<i>Evening in
August.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Albert Shawn</span> <i>is reclining on
the sofa, fully dressed, but obviously ill: an overcoat has been
drawn over his legs. A conspicuous object is a magnificent light
purple dressing-gown thrown across a chair.</i></p>

<p><i>Door bangs off. Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ilam
Carve</span> <i>in his shirt sleeves, hurriedly.</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Shawn</span> <i>feebly tries to get up.</i></p>

<!-- Page 12 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_12"
name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Now, don't move. Remember
you're a sick man, and forget you're a servant.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span> <i>shivers</i>. <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>, <i>about to put on his
dressing-gown, changes his mind, and wraps it round</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Shawn</span> <i>as well as he can</i>. <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>then puts on an oldish
coat</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. (<i>Feebly</i>.) You've
been very quick, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I found a red lamp only
three doors off. He'll be along in half a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. Did you explain what it
was, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Genially</i>.) How
could I explain what it was, you fool, when I don't know? I simply
asked to see the doctor, and I told him there was a fellow-creature
suffering at No. 126, and would he come at once. "126?" he said,
"126 has been shut up for years."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. (<i>Trying to smile</i>.)
What did you say, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I said (<i>articulating
with clearness</i>) a hundred and twenty-six&mdash;and ran off.
Then he yelled out after me that he'd come instantly.... I say,
Shawn, we're discovered. I could tell that from his sudden change
of tone. I bet the entire street knows that the celebrated Me has
arrived at last. I feel like a criminal already, dashed if I don't!
I wish <!-- Page 13 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_13"
name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>we'd gone to a hotel now. (<i>Walks
about.</i>) I say, did you make up the bed?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. I was just doing it,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But what about sheets and
so on?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. I bought some this
morning, ready hemmed, sir&mdash;with those and the travelling
rug&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, don't you think you
could work your passage out to the bed? With my help?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. Me in your bed, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Genially
bullying.</i>) Keep on in that tone&mdash;and I'll give you the
sack on the spot. Now then. Try&mdash;before the doctor comes.
(<i>Bell rings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. The bell, sir&mdash;excuse
me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Confound&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.)</p>
</div>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span> <i>coughs and puts a
handkerchief to his mouth.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>returns immediately with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dr.
Pascoe</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Glancing round
quickly.</i>) This the patient? (<i>Goes to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>, <i>and looks at him. Then, taking a
clinical thermometer from his pocket and wiping it; with marked
respect.</i>) Allow me to put this under your tongue for half a
minute. (<i>Having done so, he takes</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Shawn's</span> <i>wrist and, looking at his
watch, counts the patient's pulse. Then turning to</i>
<!-- Page 14 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_14"
name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>,
<i>in a low curt voiced</i>) When did this begin?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Just now. That is, he only
began to complain about six o'clock. We arrived in London this
morning from Madrid.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Reading
thermometer.</i>) Temperature 104-1/2. Pulse is 140&mdash;and weak.
I must have some boiling water.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>At a loss.</i>) What
for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. What for? For a
poultice.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Helplessly.</i>) But
there isn't any ... we've nothing except this spirit-lamp.
(<i>Pointing to lamp on table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. No women in the
house?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>With humour that the
doctor declines to see.</i>) Not one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Controlling his
exasperation.</i>) Never mind. I'll run round to the surgery and
get my hypodermic. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>,
<i>reassuringly and deferentially.</i>) I shall be back at once,
Mr. Carve. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>, <i>near
door.</i>) Keep your master well covered up&mdash;I suppose you can
do that?</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Shawn, my poor fellow, he
takes you for the illustrious Ilam Carve. This is what comes of me
rushing out in shirt sleeves. (<i>Gesture of despair.</i>) I can't
explain it to him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- Page 15 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_15"
name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It's all right. You'll be
infinitely better looked after, you know, and I shall be saved from
their infernal curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>. It's only this, sir. I was
half-expecting a young lady to-night, sir (<i>very feebly</i>). At
least, I believe she's young.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Shawn, I've always
suspected you were a bad lot. Now I know. I also know why you were
so devilish anxious to put me to bed early. What am I to say to
this young lady on your behalf?</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span> <i>worse, too ill to
answer. Pause. Re-enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dr.
Pascoe</span>, <i>very rapidly, with a large tumbler half-full of
hot liquid</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. You may say I've been
quick. (<i>As he bends down to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>, <i>addressing</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Get me a wine glass of clean cold
water. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>.) Now,
please. I want you to drink a little brandy and water. (<span
class="smallcaps">Shawn</span> <i>makes no response</i>.) By Jove!
(<i>The doctor pours some of the brandy and water down</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Shawn's</span> <i>throat</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Who has been wandering
about vaguely</i>.) I don't think we've got a wine glass. There's a
cup, but I suppose that isn't medical enough.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Taking a syringe from
his pocket and <!-- Page 16 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_16" name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>unscrewing it.</i>) Pour
some water in it. (<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>obeys.</i>) Now, hold it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Indicating
syringe.</i>) What is this device? <span
class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. This device? I'm going to get some
strychnine into him by injection. Steady with that cup, now!</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Pascoe drops a tablet into the syringe and screws it up
again, draws a little water up into the syringe and shakes the
syringe. Then he goes to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Shawn</span>
<i>to make the injection, on the top side of the patient's
forearm.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>still holds
the cup out mechanically.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. I've done with that
cup.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Putting the cup
down.</i>) Might I ask what's the matter with him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Pneumonia is the
matter.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Noise of some one in the hall.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Startled.</i>) Surely
that's some one in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Keep perfectly calm, my
man. It's my assistant. I left the door open on purpose for him.
He's got the poultice and things. (<i>In a loud voice as he
finishes the injection.</i>) Come along, come along there. This
way.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Edward Horning</span>
<i>with poultice, lint, bandages, etc.</i>)</p>

antiphlogistine?<!-- Page 17 --><span class="newpage"><a

<p><span class="smallcaps">Edward</span>. Yes. (<i>He looks at
patient, and exchanges a glance with</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Where's the bedroom?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. There's one there.
(<i>Pointing to double doors.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Horning</span>.) We'll get him into bed now.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Bed ready?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. I&mdash;I think he
was just making it up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Startled.</i>) Does
he make up his own bed?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Perceiving the
mistake, but resuming his calm.</i>) Always.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Controlling his
astonishment; looking through double doors and opening them wider.
To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>.) Yes, this will do.
Put those things down here a minute while we lift him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Smiling
sympathetically</i>.) I rang twice.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. The bell must be out of
order.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I couldn't be sure, but I
don't think it's the bell that's out of order.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh! You think I'm out of
order.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No. I was thinking that
you'd only just come into the house&mdash;all you famous
folk&mdash;and you hadn't quite got it straight yet&mdash;as it
were. (<i>Looking vaguely at room</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. All we famous folk?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well&mdash;I don't know
myself about that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What sort of thing?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Picture-painting, isn't
it? I mean real pictures done by hand, coloured&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Ah&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>After a slight
pause</i>.) It struck me all of a sudden, while I was waiting at
the door, that it might have been left open on purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. The front door? On
purpose? What for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh&mdash;for some one
particular to walk in without any fuss. So in I stepped.</p>

It's shut now. You don't want <i>everybody</i> walking in, do
you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Looking at</i> <span

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, no. Not a message....
But&mdash;the fact is, we're rather upset here for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes. Illness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Now, if it isn't an
indiscreet question, how <i>did</i> you know that there was
illness?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I was standing looking at
this house and wondering whether I shouldn't do better to go right
back home there and then. But "No," I said, "I've begun, and I'll
go through with it."&mdash;Well, I was standing there when what
should I see but a parlour maid pop up from the area steps next
door, and she says to me over the railings, "The doctor's just
been." Just like that, excited. So I said, "Thank you, miss." I
hope it's nothing serious?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Pneumonia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Pneumonia. What a
mercy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Mercy?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. If you look at it sensibly
it's about <!-- Page 20 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_20"
name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>the best illness anybody could have
in hot weather like this. You've got to keep them warm. The weather
does it for you. If it was typhoid now, and you'd got to keep them
cool&mdash;that <i>would</i> be awkward. Not but it passes me how
anybody can catch pneumonia in August.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Coming over from the
Continent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh! the Continent. It's
not Mr. Shawn that's ill?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Hesitating</i>.) Mr.
Shawn? Oh no, no! It's Ilam Carve.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Half whispering.
Awed</i>.) Oh, <i>him</i>! Poor thing. And nobody but men in the
house.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And who told you
<i>that</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well! (<i>waves her hand
to indicate the state of the room, smiling indulgently</i>) I
always feel sorry for gentlemen when they have to manage for
themselves, even if they're well and hearty. But when it comes to
illness&mdash;I can't bear to think about it. Still, everybody has
their own notions of comfort. And I've no doubt he'll very soon be
better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You think he will?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Blandly cheerful</i>.)
As a general rule, you may say that people do get better. That's my
experience. Of course sometimes they take a longish time. And now
and then one dies&mdash;else what use would cemeteries be?
<!-- Page 21 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_21"
name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>But as a general rule they're soon
over it. Now am I going to see Mr. Shawn, or shall
I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, if you <i>could</i>
call again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You say you hadn't a
message?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Not precisely a message.
But if you could call again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. When?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Rather eagerly</i>.)
Any time. Any time. Soon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Night after to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Why not morning?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Perhaps morning is safer.
Thank you. Very well, then. Day after to-morrow.... I suppose Mr.
Shawn has a rare fine situation here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Shrugging his
shoulders</i>.) Nothing to complain of, if you ask me.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Thank you very much. I

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I say&mdash;you won't

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, what do <i>you</i>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>At double doors,

shouldn't come along here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. (<i>Off</i>.) Yes.

<p><!-- Page 22 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_22"

class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. All right. I'll look in there.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. (<i>Nervous.</i>) What
am I to do if his respiration&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Interrupting.</i>)
Don't worry. I'm not gone yet. I must just clean up my hypodermic.
Shut those doors.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Horning</span> <i>obeys.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What's this about a
nurse?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Busy with syringe,
water, and syringe-case.</i>) I'm sending one in.
(<i>Ironically.</i>) Do you see any objection?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. On the contrary, I should
like him to be treated with every care. He's invaluable to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Staggered.</i>)
Invaluable to <i>you</i>! Of course in my line of business I get
used to meeting odd people&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Recovering from his
mistake.</i>) But you think I carry oddness rather far?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. The idea did pass through
my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Nervousness&mdash;nothing
but nervousness. I'm very nervous. And then&mdash;you know the
saying&mdash;like master, like man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Indicating back room
with a gesture; in a slightly more confidential tone as</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve's</span> <i>personal attractiveness gains
on him.</i>) Mr. Carve odd?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, very. Always was. Ever
since I've known him. You remember his first picture at the
Academy?</p>

<p><!-- Page 23 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_23"
name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span><span
class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. No, not exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Either you remember it
exactly or you don't remember it at all. Life-size picture of a
policeman blowing his whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Yes; it must have been
odd, that must.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Not a bit. The oddness of
the fellow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. What 'fellow'&mdash;your
governor?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Nods.</i>) His oddness
came out in this way&mdash;although the thing had really a great
success, from that day to this he's never painted another life-size
picture of a policeman blowing his whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. I don't see anything very
odd there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Don't you? Well, perhaps
you don't go in for art much. If you did, you'd know that the usual
and correct thing for a painter who has made a great success with a
life-size picture of a policeman blowing his whistle, is to keep on
doing life-size pictures of a policeman blowing his whistle for
ever and ever, so that the public can always count on getting from
him a life-size picture of a policeman blowing his whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. I observe you are one of
those comic valets. Nervousness again, no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Smiling and
continuing.</i>) Seeing the way he invariably flouted the public,
it's always been a mystery to me how he managed to make a name, to
say nothing of money.</p>

<!-- Page 24 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_24"
name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Money! He must make pots.
You say I don't go in for art much, but I always read the big sales
at Christie's. Why, wasn't it that policeman picture that Lord
Leonard Alcar bought for 2000 guineas last year?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, not Alcar. I think the
bobby was last bought by Texel.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Texel? Who's Texel?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Collector&mdash;United
States&mdash;one of their kings, I'm told.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Oh, him! Controls all the
ink in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Really! That's what I
should call influence. No. It was the "Pelicans feeding their
Young" that Alcar bought. Four thousand. You're getting mixed
up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Perhaps I am. I know I'm
constantly seeing Mr. Carve's name in connection with Lord Leonard
Alcar's. It's a nice question which is the best known of the
two.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Then the&mdash;governor
really is famous in England? You see we never come to England.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Famous&mdash;I should
think he was. Aren't they always saying he's the finest colourist
since Titian? And look at his prices!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. I've looked at his
prices. Titian's prices are higher, but Titian isn't what you'd
call famous with the general public, is he? <!-- Page 25 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_25" name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>What
I want to know is&mdash;is the governor famous among the general
public?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. About how famous should
you say he is?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Hesitating.</i>)
Well&mdash;(<i>abruptly</i>) that's a silly question.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, it isn't. Is he as
famous as&mdash;er&mdash;Harry Lauder?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Shakes his head.</i>)
You mustn't go to extremes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Is he as famous as Harry
Vardon?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Never heard of him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I only see these names in
the papers. Is he as famous as Bernard Shaw?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Yes, I should say he
was.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, well that's not so
bad. Better than I thought! It's so difficult to judge where one
is&mdash;er&mdash;personally concerned. Especially if you're never
on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. So it's true Mr. Carve
never comes to England?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Why should he come to
England? He isn't a portrait painter. It's true he owns this house,
but surely that isn't sufficient excuse for living in a place like
England?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Of course, if you look at
it like that, there's no particular attractiveness in England that
I've ever seen. But that answer wouldn't satisfy Redcliffe Gardens.
Redcliffe Gardens <!-- Page 26 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_26" name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>is persuaded that there
must be a special reason.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, there is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Interested, in spite
of himself.</i>) Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Confidentially.</i>)
Have a cigarette? (<i>Offering case.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Staggered anew, but
accepting.</i>) That's a swagger case.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh! (<i>Calmly.</i>) He
gave it me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Really?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, you see we're more
like brothers&mdash;been together so long. He gives me his best
suits too. Look at this waistcoat. (<i>Motions the hypnotised</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span> <i>to take a chair. They
light their cigarettes.</i>)</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Somewhat
impatient.</i>) He's not worse already?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. Where's that brandy and
water?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Be careful. He's had
about enough of that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. Seeing I've had no
dinner yet&mdash;I thought it might suit me. (<i>Exit with
tumbler.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>To Carve with renewed
eagerness.</i>) So there is a special reason why you keep out of
England.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes&mdash;shyness.</p>

<p><!-- Page 27 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_27"
name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span><span
class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. How&mdash;shyness?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Just simple shyness.
Shyness is a disease with the governor, a perfect disease.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. But everyone's shy. The
more experience I get the more convinced I am that we're all shy.
Why, you were shy when you came to fetch me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Did you notice it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Of course. And I was shy
when I came in here. I was thinking to myself, "Now I'm going to
see the great Ilam Carve actually in the flesh," and I was shy.
You'd think my profession would have cured me of being shy, but not
a bit. Nervous disease, of course! Ought to be treated as such.
Almost universal. Besides, even if he is shy, your
governor&mdash;even if he's a hundredfold shy, that's no reason for
keeping out of England. Shyness is not one of those diseases you
can cure by change of climate.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Pardon me. My esteemed
employer's shyness is a special shyness. He's only shy when he has
to play the celebrity. So long as people take him for no one in
particular he's quite all right. For instance, he's never shy with
me. But instantly people approach him as the celebrity, instantly
he sees in the eye of the beholder any consciousness of being in
the presence of a toff&mdash;then he gets desperately shy, and his
one desire is <!-- Page 28 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_28"
name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>to be alone at sea or to be buried
somewhere deep in the bosom of the earth. (<span
class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span> <i>laughs.</i>) What are you
laughing at? (<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>also
laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Go on, go on. I'm
enjoying it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, but seriously! It's
true what I tell you. It amounts almost to a tragedy in the
brilliant career of my esteemed. You see now that England would be
impossible for him as a residence. You see, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Why, even on the
Continent, in the big towns and the big hotels, we often travel
incognito for safety. It's only in the country districts that he
goes about under his own name.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. So that he's really got
no friends?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. None, except a few Italian
and Spanish peasants&mdash;and me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Well, well! It's an
absolute mania then, this shyness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Slightly hurt.</i>)
Oh, not so bad as that! And then it's only fair to say he has his
moments of great daring&mdash;you may say rashness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. All timid people are like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Are they? (<i>Musing.</i>)
We're here now owing to one of his moments of rashness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Indeed!</p>

<!-- Page 29 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_29"
name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. We met an English
lady in a village in Andalusia, and&mdash;well, of course, I can't
tell you everything&mdash;but she flirted with him and he flirted
with her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Under his own name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. And then he proposed
to her. I knew all along it was a blunder.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Ironic.</i>) Did
you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. She belonged to the
aristocracy, and she was one of those amateur painters that wander
about the Continent by themselves&mdash;you know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. And did she accept?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh yes. They got as far as
Madrid together, and then all of a sudden my esteemed saw that he
had made a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. And what then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. We fled the country. We
hooked it. The idea of coming to London struck him&mdash;just the
caprice of a man who's lost his head&mdash;and here we are.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>After a pause.</i>)
He doesn't seem to me from the look of him to be a man
who'd&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;strictly avoided women.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Startled, with a
gesture towards back.</i>) Him?</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span> <i>nods.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Really! Confound him! Now I've always <!-- Page 30 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_30"
name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>suspected that; though he manages to
keep his goings-on devilish quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Rising.</i>) It
occurs to me, my friend, that I'm listening to too much. But you're
so persuasive.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It's such a pleasure to
talk freely&mdash;for once in a way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Freely&mdash;is the
word.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh! He won't mind!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>In a peculiar
tone.</i>) It's quite possible!</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. (<i>To Carve.</i>) I
say, it's just occurred to me, Mr. Carve hasn't been digging or
gardening or anything, I suppose, and then taken cold after?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Digging? Oh no. He must
have got a bad chill on the steamer. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. Nothing. Only his hands
and finger-nails are so rough.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>After thinking.</i>)
Oh, I see! All artists are like that. Messing about with paints and
acids and things. Look at my hands.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. But are you an artist
too?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Recovering himself,
calmly.</i>) No, no.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>To Horning.</i>)
How's he going on?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. (<i>Shrugs his
shoulders.</i>) I'm sure the base of both lungs is practically
solid.</p>

<p><!-- Page 31 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_31"
name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span><span
class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Well, we can't do more than we
have done, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Horning</span>. He'll never pull
through.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Calmly.</i>) I should
certainly be surprised if he did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Astounded.</i>)
But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. But what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You don't mean to
say&mdash;Why, he's a strong healthy man!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Precisely. Not very
unusual for your strong healthy man to die of pneumonia in
twenty-four hours. You ought to know, at your age, that it's a
highly dangerous thing to be strong and healthy. (<i>Turning
away.</i>) I'll have another look at him before I go.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Extremely
perturbed.</i>) But this is ridiculous. I simply don't know what I
shall do without that man.</p>

not.</p>

<p><!-- Page 32 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_32"

It's some relief to know that. I couldn't have faced a coroner.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Staring at him.</i>)
Perfectly ordinary case.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. That's what you call
perfectly ordinary, is it? A man is quite well on Tuesday
afternoon, and dead at 4 a.m. on Thursday morning. (<i>Looking at
his watch.</i>) My watch has stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>With fierce
sarcasm.</i>) One of those cheap German watches, I suppose, that
stop when you don't wind them up! It's a singular thing that when
people stay up all night they take it for granted their watches are
just as excited as they are. Look here, you'll be collapsing soon.
When did you have anything to eat last?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Almost half an hour ago.
Two sausages that were sent in yesterday for the nurse.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. She's gone?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Well, take my advice. Try
to get some sleep now. You've had no reply from the
relatives&mdash;the auctioneer cousin&mdash;what's his Christian
name&mdash;Cyrus?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, I&mdash;I didn't
telegraph&mdash;I forgot&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Well, upon my soul! I
specially reminded you yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I didn't know the
address.</p>

<p><!-- Page 33 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_33"

class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Ever heard of the London
Directory? You'd better run out and wire instantly. You don't seem
to realize that the death of a man like Ilam Carve will make
something of a stir in the world. And you may depend on it that
whether they'd quarrelled or not, Cyrus Carve will want to know why
he wasn't informed of the illness at once. You've let yourself in
for a fine row, and well you deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>After a few
paces.</i>) See here, doctor. I'm afraid there's been some mistake.
(<i>Facing him nervously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="smalldiv">

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. (<i>Firmly.</i>) Listen
to me, my man. There's been no sort of mistake. Everything has been
done that could be done. Don't you get ideas into your head. Lie
down and rest. You're done up, and if you aren't careful you'll be
ill. I'll communicate with Cyrus Carve. I can telephone, and while
I'm about it I'll ring up the registrar too&mdash;he'll probably
send a clerk round.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Registrar?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Registrar of deaths.
There'll be all kinds of things to attend to. (<i>Moving to go

Yes, very sudden, very sudden. There were three of us&mdash;a
nurse, my assistant, and myself. This is Mr. Shawn, the deceased's
valet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Morning. (<i>Looks round
at disorder of room contemptuously.</i>) Pigstye!... My name is
Cyrus Carve. I'm your late master's cousin and his only relative.
You've possibly never heard of me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Curtly.</i>) Oh yes, I
have! You got up a great quarrel when you were aged twelve, you and
he.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Your manner isn't very
respectful, my friend. However you may have treated my cousin, be
good enough to remember you're not <i>my</i> valet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. How did you get to know
about it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. I suppose he forbade you
to send for me, eh? (<i>Pause.</i>) Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Jumping at this
suggestion.</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. So that was it.</p>

(<i>Ignoring</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>.) Ha! Well,
since you're so curious, I saw it a quarter of an hour ago in a
special edition of a halfpenny rag; I was on my way to the office.
(<i>Showing paper.</i>) Here you are! <i>The Evening Courier.</i>
Quite a full account of the illness. You couldn't send for me, but
you could chatter to some journalist.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I've never spoken to a
journalist in my life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Then
how&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. It's probably my
assistant. His brother is something rather important on the
<i>Courier</i>, and he may have telephoned to him. It's a big item
of news, you know, Mr. Carve.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Drily.</i>) I imagine
so. Where is the body?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Upstairs. (<i>Moving
towards door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Thanks. I will go
alone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. Large room at
back&mdash;first floor.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>, L.)</p>

<p>I think I'd prefer to leave you to yourselves now. Of course,
Mr. Carve will do all that's necessary. You might give him my card,
and tell him I'm at his service as regards signing the death
certificate and so on. (<i>Handing card.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Taking card
perfunctorily.</i>) Very well. Then you're going?

suddenly puts out his hand, which</i> <span

advice?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I&mdash;I
ought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pascoe</span>. If I were you I should
try to get something better than valeting. It's not your line. You
may have suited Ilam Carve, but you'd never suit an ordinary
employer. You aren't a fool&mdash;not by any means.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Well what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Recognize your cousin?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Of course a man of
forty-five isn't like a boy of twelve, but I think I may say I
should have recognized him anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Taken aback.</i>)
Should you indeed. (<i>A pause.</i>) And so you're Cyrus, the
little boy that kicked and tried to bite in that historic affray of
thirty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Look here, I fancy you and
I had better come to an understanding at once. What salary did my
cousin pay you for your remarkable services?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What salary?</p>

<!-- Page 37 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_37"

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. What salary?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. When were you last
paid?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. When were you last

yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Taking a note and gold
from his pocket-book and pocket.</i>) Here's seven pounds&mdash;a
month's wages in lieu of notice. It's rather more than a month's
wages, but I can't do sums in my head just now. (<i>Holding out
money.</i>)</p>

your master keep his private papers and so on in England or
somewhere on the Continent&mdash;what bank?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What bank? He didn't keep
them in any bank.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Where did he keep them
then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. He kept them himself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>With a "tut-tut" noise

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. That is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Come now, is it his or is
it yours? Now be careful.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. His. (<i>Angrily, as</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span> <i>roughly handles a box.</i>)
Now then, mind what you're about! Those are etching things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. I shall mind what I'm
about. And what's this?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. That's a typewriter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes, I mean mine.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Then why don't you say so?
What do you want a typewriter for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Savagely.</i>) What
the devil has that got to do with you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Looking up calmly from
the examination of a dispatch box.</i>) If you can't keep a civil
tongue in your head I'll pitch you down the front-door steps and
your things after you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I've got something to tell
you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Silence, and answer my
questions! Are his papers in this dispatch box?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Taking them.</i>) So
you keep his keys?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>As he is examining
papers in box.</i>) What are you laughing at?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I'm not laughing. I'm
smiling. (<i>Rising and looking curiously at box.</i>) There's
nothing there except lists of securities and pictures and a few
oddments&mdash;passports and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. There appears to be some
money. I'm glad you've left that. Quite a lot, in fact. (<i>Showing
notes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Here, steady! There's
twelve thousand francs there besides some English notes. That's
mine.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Yours, eh? He was taking
care of it for you, no doubt?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Hesitating.</i>)
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. When you can furnish me
with his receipt for the deposit, my man, it shall be handed to
you. Till then it forms part of the estate. (<i>Looking at a packet
of letters.</i>) "Alice Rowfant."</p>

<!-- Page 40 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_40"

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And those letters are mine
too.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Reading.</i>) "My
dearest boy"&mdash;Were you Lady Alice Rowfant's dearest boy?
Anyhow, we'll burn them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. So long as you burn them I
don't mind.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Indeed! (<i>Continues to
examine papers, cheque foils, etc. Then opens a document.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh! Is <i>that</i> still
there? I thought it was destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Do you know what it
is?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. It's a will that was
made in Venice I don't know how long ago&mdash;just after your aunt
died and you had that appalling and final shindy by correspondence
about the lease of this house. Everything is left for the
establishment of an International Gallery of Painting and Sculpture
in London, and you're the sole executor, and you get a legacy of
five pounds for your trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Yes.... So I see. No doubt
my cousin imagined it would annoy me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. He did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. He told you so?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. He said it would be one in
the eye for you&mdash;and he wondered whether you'd decline the
executorship.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Well, my man, I may tell
you at once that I shall not renounce probate. I never expected a
penny from my cousin. I always assumed he'd do something silly with
his <!-- Page 41 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_41"
name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>money, and I'm relieved to find it's
no worse. In fact, the idea of a great public institution in London
being associated with my family is rather pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But he meant to destroy
that will long since.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>As he cons the
will.</i>) How do you know? Has he made a later will?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Well, then! Besides, I
fail to see why you should be so anxious to have it destroyed. You
come into eighty pounds a year under it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I was forgetting that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Reading.</i>) "I
bequeath to my servant, Albert Shawn, who I am convinced is a
thorough rascal, but who is an unrivalled valet, courier, and
factotum, the sum of eighty pounds a year for life, payable
quarterly in advance, provided he is in my service at the time of
my death."</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>laughs

<p>You don't want to lose that, do you? Of course, if the term
"thorough rascal" is offensive to you, you can always decline the
money. (<i>Folds up will and puts it in his pocket</i>&mdash;<span

He might have waited.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. But he didn't. His
house is only three doors off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Looking at his

haven't begun to put your things together, and you've only got a
bit over half an hour. In less than that time I shall be back. I

The man is an ass.</p>

no. He wouldn't let me tell him. And perhaps if I'd told him he
wouldn't have believed me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. What did he do to stop you
from telling him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>At a loss,
vaguely.</i>) I don't know&mdash;Wouldn't let me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. If you ask me, I should
say the truth is, you didn't want to tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Impressed.</i>) Now I
wonder if you're right.</p>

you <i>didn't</i> want to tell him.</p>

Not at all. I simply say, as a general rule it's the best thing to
do. But this is no business of mine, and I'm sure I'm not
inquisitive.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Solemnly.</i>) He

the first thing I have to do is to apologize for my behaviour on

upset you were! And then I'm not sure whether I shouldn't have done
the same thing myself in your place.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Done the same
yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I may be wrong, but
it occurred to me your idea was that you'd like to have a look at
me before giving yourself away, as it were. Of course, I sent you
my photographs, but photographs aren't much better than
gravestones&mdash;for being reliable, and some folks are prejudiced
against matrimonial agencies, even when they make use of them. It's
natural. Now I've got no such prejudice. If you want to get married
you want to get married, and there you are. It's no use pretending
you don't. And there's as much chance of being happy through a

least&mdash;that's what <i>I</i> think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Collecting his
wits.</i>) Just so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You may tell me that
people who go to a matrimonial agency stand a chance of getting let
in. Well, people who don't go to a matrimonial agency stand a
chance of getting let in, too. Besides, I shouldn't give a baby a
razor for a birthday present, and I shouldn't advise a young girl
to go to a matrimonial agency. But I'm not a young girl. If it's a
question of the male sex, I may say that I've been there before.
You understand me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I think I told you
pretty nearly everything important in my letter. Didn't I?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Let me see
now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I mean the one I sent to
the office of the <i>Matrimonial News.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Mechanically feeling
in his pockets, pulling out papers and putting them back.</i>)
Where did I put it? Oh, perhaps it's in the pocket of another coat.
(<i>Goes to a coat of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Shawn's</span>
<i>hanging on inner knob of double doors, and empties all the
pockets, bringing the contents, including a newspaper, to the
table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Picking up an
envelope.</i>) Yes, that's it&mdash;I can feel the photograph. You
seem to keep things in the pockets of all your coats.</p>

<!-- Page 47 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_47"
name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. If you knew what I've been
through this last day or two&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Soothingly.</i>) Yes,
yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I haven't had a quiet
moment. Now&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Reading letter.</i>) "Dear Sir, in
reply to your advertisement, I write to you with particulars of my
case. I am a widow, aged thirty-two years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And anybody that likes can
see my birth certificate. That's what I call talking.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. My dear lady!
(<i>Continuing to read.</i>) "Thirty-two years. My father was a
jobbing builder, well known in Putney and Wandsworth. My husband
was a rent collector and estate agent. He died four years ago of
appendicitis (<i>hesitating</i>) caught&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Caused.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I beg pardon,
"&mdash;caused by accidentally swallowing a bristle out of his
tooth-brush, the same being discovered at the operation. I am an
orphan, a widow, and have no children. In consequence I feel very
lonely, and my first experience not being distasteful, indeed the
reverse, I am anxious to try again, provided I can meet with a
sincere helpmeet of good family. I am the owner of the above house,
rated at forty-five pounds a year, in one of the nicest streets in
Putney, and I have private means of some three pounds a week, from
brewery shares bringing in fifteen <!-- Page 48 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_48" name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>per
cent. I will say nothing about my appearance, but enclose latest
carte-de-visite photograph."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I had it taken on
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. "As to my tastes, I will
only say that as a general rule they are quiet. If the above seems
in your line, I shall be obliged if you will write and send me
particulars of yourself, with photographs.&mdash;Yours truly, JANET
CANNOT." Well, Mrs. Cannot, your letter is an absolute model.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I suppose you <i>did</i>
get dozens?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well&mdash;&mdash;By the
way, what's this type-written thing in the envelope?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Looking at it.</i>) It
looks like a copy of your answer.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. If it isn't a rude
question, Mr. Shawn, why do you typewrite your letters? It seems
so&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;public.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Half to himself.</i>)
So <i>thats</i> the explanation of the typewriter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Puzzled.</i>) I
suppose it's because you're a private secretary.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Equally puzzled.</i>)
Private secretary! I&mdash;shall we just glance through my reply?
(<i>Reads.</i>) "My dear Mrs. Cannot, your letter inspires me with
more confidence than any of the dozens of others I have received."
(<i>They look at each other, smiling.</i>) "<!-- Page 49 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_49" name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>As
regards myself, I should state at once that I am and have been for
many years private secretary, indeed I may say almost companion, to
the celebrated painter. Mr. Ilam Carve, whose magnificent pictures
you are doubtless familiar with."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No, I'm not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Really. "We have been
knocking about England together for longer than I care to remember,
and I personally am anxious for a change. Our present existence is
very expensive. I feel the need of a home and the companionship of
just such a woman as yourself. Although a bachelor, I think I am
not unfitted for the domestic hearth. My age is forty." That's a
mistake of the typewriter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Forty-five it ought to
be.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, honestly, I
shouldn't have thought it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. "My age is forty-five. By
a strange coincidence Mr. Carve has suggested to me that we set out
for England to-morrow. At Dover I will telegraph you with a
rendezvous. In great haste. Till then, my dear Mrs. Cannot, believe
me," etc.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You didn't send a
photograph.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Perhaps I was afraid of
prejudicing you in advance.</p>

<p><!-- Page 50 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_50"
name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.
(<i>Laughs.</i>) Eh, Mr. Shawn! There's thousands of young
gentlemen alive and kicking in London this minute that would give a
great deal to be only half as good looking as you are. And so
you're a bachelor?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, quite.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Two bachelors, as you say,
knocking about Europe together. (<span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>laughs quietly but heartily to
himself.</i>) By the way, how is Mr. Carve? I hope he's better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Mr. Carve?...(<i>Suddenly
stops laughing.</i>) Oh! (<i>Lamely, casually.</i>) He's dead!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Stocked.</i>) Dead?
When?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Early this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Rising.</i>) And us
chattering away like this. Why didn't you tell me at once, Mr.
Shawn?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I forgot for the moment. I
wasn't thinking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Forgot?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Simply and sincerely,
but very upset.</i>) Now, Mrs. Cannot, I assure you I feel that
man's death. I admit I had very little affection for
him&mdash;certainly not much respect&mdash;but we'd been together a
long time, and his death is a shock to me. Yes, really. But I've
had to think so much about my own case&mdash;and then a scene, a
regular scene with Cyrus Carve. And then you coming. The fact
is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 51 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_51"
name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.
(<i>Sympathetically.</i>) The fact is, you scarcely know what
you're doing, my poor Mr. Shawn. You're on wires, that's what's the
matter with you&mdash;hysteria. I know what it is as well as
anybody. You'll excuse me saying so, but you're no ordinary man.
You're one of these highly-strung people and you ought to take care
of yourself. Well, I'll go now, and if it's mutually agreeable we
might perhaps meet again in a month's time&mdash;say.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. A month? But what am I to
do with myself for a month? Do you know you're absolutely the only
friend I've got in London&mdash;in England. We're never here. I'm
an utter stranger. You can't leave me like that&mdash;for a
month&mdash;four weeks&mdash;four Sundays. I haven't the least idea
what's going to happen to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. The very best thing that
can happen to you is bed. You go to bed and stop there for a couple
of days. There's nothing like it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes, but where?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Why, here of course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I've got to be out of this
place in half an hour, less. The fact is, Cyrus Carve has been
extremely&mdash;er&mdash;pert. He's paid me a month's salary and
I'm off at once. In under thirty minutes I shall be on the
streets.</p>

<!-- Page 52 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_52"
name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I never liked that man.
Well, then, you must go to some nice respectable
boarding-house.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But I don't know any nice
respectable boarding-house.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh! There are thousands
and thousands in London. Look in the <i>Telegraph.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I haven't had a paper
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Any day will do. They're
in all the papers every day. What's this? (<i>Taking up folded
dirty newspaper and opening it.</i>) Now, let's see. Well, what
about this? "A beautiful private hotel of the highest class.
Luxuriously furnished. Visitors' comfort studied. Finest position
in London. Cuisine a speciality. Suitable for persons of superior
rank. Bathroom. Electric light. Separate tables. No irritating
extras. Single rooms from two and a half guineas. 250 Queen's
Gate." Quite close by! (<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>says nothing.</i>) Perhaps that's a bit dear. Here's another.
"<i>Not</i> a boarding-house. A magnificent mansion. Forty bedrooms
by Waring. Superb public saloons by Maple. Parisian chef. Separate
tables. <i>Four</i> bathrooms. Card-rooms. Billiard room. Vast
lounge. Special sanitation. Young, cheerful, musical society.
Bridge (small). Finest position in London. No irritating extras.
Single rooms from two guineas." What about that?</p>

<!-- Page 53 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_53"
name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Shakes his head.</i>)
I don't think I should fancy it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I won't say but what two
guineas a week is a lot.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And I was thinking how
cheap it was.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Staring.</i>) Well, of
course, if you've got money to <i>fling</i> about.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Upon my soul I don't know
what money I have got.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. It'll be just as well to
find out before you get into the street.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Let's see. Well, there's
seven pounds (<i>showing it.</i>) and this (<i>pulling silver and
gold from another pocket</i>). Not much is it? Sixteen shillings
and sixpence. It's true I've an annuity of eighty pounds. I was
forgetting that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Pleased.</i>) Have you
indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. But an annuity isn't
ready cash, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Picking up Shawn's
pocket-book.</i>) And this? This seems rather thick.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I was forgetting that too.
(<i>Opens it and takes out many notes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. My word! And you'd
forgotten <i>that</i>! You ought to see a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Counting.</i>)
Twenty-one fives, and ten tens. That makes two hundred and five
pounds. (<i>Half to himself.</i>) I always knew I was a bad
lot&mdash;but where <i>did</i> I collar all that
<!-- Page 54 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_54"
name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>from? (<i>To Janet.</i>) I know what
I shall do! I shall go to the Grand Babylon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. The Grand Babylon Hotel?
But it's the dearest hotel in London.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. In the big towns we always
went to the best hotel. It's cheapest in the end.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You're very persuasive,
but you'll never make me believe you'll save money by staying at
the Grand Babylon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Rising and beginning
to collect things&mdash;tries to fold up a pair of trousers.</i>)
Now, Mrs. Cannot, will you do me a favour?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You'll spoil these
trousers.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Will you come and lunch
with me at the Grand Babylon to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. But I've never been in
such a place in my life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Remember. You're my only
friend. Will you come and lunch with me at the Grand Babylon
to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Timidly.</i>) I should
like to. (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Here, give me those trousers, do!

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ilam Carve</span> <i>and</i> <span

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I'm really delighted to
see you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Examining his
features.</i>) But surely you're not feeling very well?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I'm not. Perhaps it's
these sleepless nights I've had.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You're shivering.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I was wearing my
dressing-gown. I nearly always do when I'm alone. Do you think
you'd mind if I put it on again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Do you mean to say you
took it off because of me? (<i>Seizing dressing-gown firmly.</i>)
Mr. Shawn, will you oblige me by <!-- Page 56 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_56"
name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>getting-into this <i>at</i> once?
(<i>She helps him on with dressing-gown.</i>) What a beauty!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. Cousin Cyrus thought
so too. He didn't want me to bring it away. Still, I beat him on
<i>that</i> point. (<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>
<i>arranges the collar.</i>) Do you know, you do me good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I should think so. I
suppose when gentlemen live alone they're pretty nearly always
unwell, as it were. If it isn't a cold, it's stomach, I expect. And
truly, I'm not surprised, the way they go on! Now, will you sit
down in that chair and keep your legs covered&mdash;August or no
August! If you ask me, it's influenza you're sickening for.
(<i>Sound of distant orchestral.</i>) Music?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Nodding and sitting
down in easy chair.</i>) Well, and what's the news from outside? I
haven't stirred since yesterday noon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Seems to me there's no
news except your Mr. Carve's death.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Really! Is it so much
talked about as all that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. It's on all the
posters&mdash;very big. All along Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square
and the Strand the newspaper boys, and the newspaper old men too,
are wearing it like aprons, as it were. I read the <i>Telegraph</i>
myself. There was nearly a page of it in the <i>Telegraph.</i></p>

<!-- Page 57 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_57"
name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Staggered.</i>) Nearly
a page of it in the <i>Telegraph</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, besides a leading
article. Haven't you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I never read obituaries of
artists in the papers.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Neither do I. But I should
have thought <i>you</i> would.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, they make me angry.
Obituaries of archbishops aren't so bad. Newspapers seem to
understand archbishops. But when they begin about artists&mdash;you
cannot imagine the astounding nonsense they talk.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Protesting against his
heat.</i>) Now! You're still all on wires. Why should that make you
angry?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What did the
<i>Telegraph</i> say? Did you look at it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh yes. It appears Mr.
Carve was a very eccentric person&mdash;avoiding society and so
on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Resentful.</i>)
Eccentric! There you are! He wasn't eccentric in the least. The
only society he avoided was the society of gaping fools.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I'm just telling you
what it said. Then, let me see&mdash;what else did it say? Oh! It
said the sole question was whether Mr. Carve was the greatest
painter since Velasquez&mdash;is that how you pronounce
it?&mdash;or <!-- Page 58 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_58"
name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>whether he was the greatest painter
that ever lived.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Interested.</i>)
Really! It said that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Nodding.</i>) You
ought to read it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Upon my soul I think I
must. (<i>Attempts to rise.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Now, please, don't move.
What is it you want?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I was only going to
telephone and have the daily papers sent up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Where is the
telephone?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Pointing.</i>)
There.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. So they've put a telephone
in your room?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Telephone in every
room.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Going to
telephone.</i>) Can I telephone for you? I never have telephoned,
and I should like to. How do you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Just take that thing off
the hook and talk into it. (<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>
<i>gingerly obeys.</i>) It won't explode.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. What am I to say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Tell them to send me up
the daily papers at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. All?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. But will they?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Into telephone.</i>)
Please will you send up all the daily papers at once.</p>

Thanks very much. Now you can hang it up again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. So this is the Grand
Babylon Hotel? Well it's a queer place. (<i>Her eyes rove round the
room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What are you looking
for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. To speak plainly, I was
looking for the bed. I must say I was rather surprised when the
young man at the desk said I was to go up to your room.... But
really, every thing's so nicely arranged.... I suppose it's one of
those folding beds that turn into bookcases and things?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Laughs.</i>) No. This
is my sitting-room.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Your sitting-room?
(<i>Pointing to door</i>, R.) Then that's the bedroom?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Pointing to another
door.</i>) And what's that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. That's one way to my
bathroom. In a big hotel I always take a suite, you know. It's so
much more comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Isn't it rather
expensive?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. To tell you the truth, I
didn't ask the price.</p>

straight to the point, hating subtleties. In connection with your
late employer's death <!-- Page 64 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_64" name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>a great responsibility
is laid upon me, and I have come to you for
information&mdash;information which I have failed to obtain either
from Mr. Cyrus Carve, or the doctor, or the nurse.... Was Mr. Carve
a Catholic?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. A Catholic?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. He came of a Catholic
family did he not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes&mdash;I believe
so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. The cousin, Mr. Cyrus
Carve, I regret to say, denies the faith of his
childhood&mdash;denies it, I also regret to say, with a vivacity
that amounts almost to bad manners. In fact, he was extremely rude
to me when I tried to give him some idea of the tremendous revival
of Catholicism which is the outstanding feature of intellectual
life in England to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Ilam Carve was not a
Catholic.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Mind, I do not ask if he
died in the consolations of the faith. I know that he did not. I
have learnt that it occurred to neither you nor the doctor nor the
nurse to send for a priest. Strange omission. But not the fault of
the dying man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Ilam Carve was not a
Catholic.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Then what was he?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Nothing in particular.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Then I claim him. Then I
claim him.... Honoria!</p>

(<i>In a new tone.</i>.) Look here&mdash;what's all this about?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. (<i>Rising.</i>) I will
tell you at once what it is about, Mr. Shawn. There is a question
of Ilam Carve being buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Thunderstruck.</i>)
Buried in Westminster Abbey?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Lady Leonard Alcar has
consulted me about the matter. I may say that I have the honour to
be her spiritual director. Probably you know that Lord Leonard
Alcar owns the finest collection of Ilam Carve's pictures in
Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I've often wondered who it
is that settles whether people shall be buried in the Abbey or not.
So it's Lady Leonard Alcar!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Not exactly! Not exactly!
But Lady Leonard Alcar is a great lady. She has vast influence. The
most influential convert to Catholicism of the last thirty years.
She is aunt to no less than four dukes, and Lord Leonard is uncle
to two others.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Ironically.</i>) I
quite see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. (<i>Eagerly.</i>) You
see&mdash;don't you? Her advice on these matters carries enormous
weight. A suggestion from her amounts to&mdash;to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. A decree absolute.</p>

<p><!-- Page 66 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_66"
name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.
(<i>Simply.</i>) Is she what they call the ruling classes?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. (<i>Bows.</i>) Lady Leonard
and I have talked the matter over, and I pointed out to her that if
this great genius was a member of the Church of England and if the
sorrowing nation at large deems him worthy of the supreme honour of
a national funeral, then by all means let him be buried in the
Abbey. But if he was a Catholic, then I claim him for Westminster
Cathedral, that magnificent fane which we have raised as a symbol
of our renewed vitality. Now, was he a member of the Church of
England?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Loudly.</i>) Decidedly
not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Good! Then I claim him. I
detest casuistry and I claim him. I have only one other question.
You knew him well&mdash;intimately&mdash;for many years. On your
conscience, Mr. Shawn, what interment in your opinion would he
himself have preferred?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>After a pause.</i>) It
wouldn't make much difference to him either way, would it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>With an outburst.</i>)
The whole thing is preposterous.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. (<i>Ignoring the
outburst.</i>) My course seems quite clear. I shall advise Lady
Leonard&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Don't you think you're
rather young to be in sole charge of this country?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. (<i>Smoothly.</i>) My dear
sir, I am nothing <!-- Page 67 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_67" name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>but a humble priest who
gives counsel when counsel is sought. And I may say that in this
affair of the interment of our great national painter, there are
other influences than mine. For instance, my sister, Honoria, who
happens also to be president of the Ladies' Water Colour
Society&mdash;(<i>gesture of alarm from</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>)&mdash;my sister has a great
responsibility. She is the favourite niece of&mdash;(<i>Whispers
in</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve's</span> <i>ear</i>.)
Consequently&mdash;(<i>Makes an impressive pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. You see my uncle is a
bachelor and I keep house for him. Anselm used to live with us too,
until he left the Church.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Until I <i>joined</i> the
Church, Honoria. Now Honoria wishes to be perfectly fair; she
entirely realizes her responsibility; and that is why she has come
with me to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Benignantly.</i>) So
that's how these things are decided! I see I'd got quite a wrong
notion of politics and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Granted.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. There's one question I
should so like to ask you, Mr. Shawn. In watercolours did Mr. Carve
use Chinese white <!-- Page 68 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_68" name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>freely or did he stick
to transparent colour, like the old English school? I wonder if you
understand me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Interested.</i>) He
used Chinese white like anything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. Oh! I'm so glad. You
remember that charming water-colour of the Venetian gondolier in
the Luxembourg. We had a great argument after we got home last
Easter as to whether the oar was put in with Chinese white&mdash;or
just 'left out,' you know!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Chinese white, of course.
My notion is that it doesn't matter a fig how you get effects so
long as you do get them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. And that was his notion
too? (<i>Telephone bell rings</i>, <span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>answers it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. His? Rather. You bet it
was.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. I'm so glad. I'm so
glad. I knew I was right about Chinese white. Oh, Anselm, do let
him be buried in the Abbey! Do let me suggest to
uncle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. My dear girl, ask your
conscience. Enthusiasm for art I can comprehend; I can even
sympathize with it. But if this grave national question is to be
decided by considerations of Chinese white&mdash;&mdash;</p>

A Dr. Horning. He says he's Dr. Pascoe's assistant and he attended

<p><span class="smallcaps">Peter</span>. A hundred and fifty!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Or burning at the

<p><span class="smallcaps">Peter</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Looe</span>.) What does he say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Mr. Shawn is indisposed.
We've just been discussing the question of the burial in the Abbey.
I think I may say, if it interests you as an item of news, that
Ilam Carve will not be buried in the Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Peter</span>. (<i>Lightly.</i>) Oh yes
he will, Father. There was a little doubt about it until we got
particulars of his will this morning. But his will settled it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. His will?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Peter</span>. Yes. Didn't you know? No,
you wouldn't. Well, his estate will come out at about a couple of
hundred thousand, and he's left it practically all for an
International Gallery of Modern Art in London. Very ingenious plan.
None of your Chantrey Bequest business. Three pictures and one
piece of sculpture are to be bought each year in London. Fixed
price &pound;400 each, large or small. Trustees are to be business
men&mdash;bank directors. But they can't choose the works. The
works are to be chosen by the students at South Kensington and the
Academy Schools. Works by R.A.'s and A.R.A.'s are absolutely
barred. Works by students themselves absolutely barred, too. Cute
that, eh? That's the arrangement for <!-- Page 72 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_72"
name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>England. Similar arrangement for
France, Italy, and Germany. He gives the thing a start by making it
a present of his own collection&mdash;stored somewhere in Paris. I
don't mean his own paintings&mdash;he bars those. Unusually modest,
eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. How perfectly splendid!
We shall have a real live gallery at last. Surely Anselm, after
that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. Quite beside the point. I
shall certainly oppose.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Peter</span>. Oppose what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. The burial in the Abbey. I
shall advise Lady Leonard Alcar&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Peter</span>. No use, Father. Take my
word. The governor's made up his mind. He's been fearfully keen on
art lately. I don't know why. We were in front of everybody else
with the news of Ilam Carve's death, and the governor's making a
regular pet of him. He says it's quite time we buried an artist in
Westminster Abbey, and he's given instructions to the whole team.
Didn't you see the <i>Mercury</i> this morning? Anybody who opposes
a national funeral for Ilam Carve will be up against the governor.
Of course, I tell you that as a friend&mdash;confidentially.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. (<i>Shaken.</i>) Well, I
shall see what Lady Leonard says.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Rising in an angry,

he's a philanthropist, not because he's an artist. That's England
all over.... Well, I'm hanged if I'll have it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Looe</span>. But, my dear

goes on like this. And now, blessed if he isn't Ilam Carve!

is what you call being shy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span>, <i>who is now bending over
him.</i>) It must be stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>As the others go out;

My word, how cold your hands are! (<i>Going quickly to telephone

<h3>SCENE 2</h3>

<br />


<p><span class="smallcaps">Time</span>.&mdash;<i>Afternoon, four
days later.</i></p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>is dozing in an
easy-chair.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>in his
dressing-gown.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Starting up.</i>) Mr.
Shawn, what are you doing out of bed? After such a dose of flu as
you've had!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I'm doing nothing out of
bed. (<i>Twiddles his thumbs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. But you've no right to be
out of bed at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I was afraid I hadn't. But
I called <!-- Page 75 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_75"
name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>and called, and there was no answer.
So then I began to argue the point. Why not get up? I'd had a
tremendous long sleep. I felt singularly powerful. And I thought
you'd gone home.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Nay&mdash;that you never
did!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I did, honestly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Do you mean to say you
thought for a single moment I should go home and leave you like
that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes. But of course I
thought you might be coming back sooner or later.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well I never!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You've scarcely left me
for three days and three nights, Mrs. Cannot, so far as I remember.
Surely it was natural for me to suppose that you'd gone home to
your own affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Sarcastically.</i>) It
didn't occur to you I might have dropped off to sleep?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Now, don't be angry. I'm
only convalescent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Will you kindly march
right back to bed this instant?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, I'm dashed if I
do!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I beg pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I say, I'm dashed if I do!
I won't stir until I've thanked you. I've been ill I don't know how
many times; but this is the first time in my life I've ever enjoyed
being <!-- Page 76 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_76"
name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>ill. D'you know (<i>with an ingenuous
smile.</i>) I'd really no idea what nursing was.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Drily.</i>) Hadn't
you? Well, if you call <i>that</i> nursing, I don't. But it was the
best I could do in this barracks, with the kitchen a mile and a
half off, and a pack of men that can't understand English gaping at
you all day in evening-dress. I dare say this is a very good hotel
for reading newspapers in. But if you want anything that isn't on
the menu, it's as bad as drawing money out of the post office
savings bank. You should see me nurse in my own house.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I should like to. Even in
this barracks (<i>imitating her.</i>) you've quite altered my views
of life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, and they wanted
altering. When I think of you and that other poor fellow wandering
about all alone on that Continent&mdash;without the slightest
notion of what comfort is.... Well, I'll say this&mdash;it's a
pleasure to nurse you. Now, will you go back to bed?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I suppose coffee's on the
menu?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Coffee?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I think I should like some
<i>caf&eacute; au lait</i>, and a roll.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Rising.</i>) You can
have hot milk if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. All right. And then when
I've had it I'll go to bed.</p>

<!-- Page 77 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_77"
name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>At telephone.</i>) Are
you there?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Picking up a sheet of
paper from table.</i>) Hello! What's this? Hotel
bill-receipted?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I should think so indeed!
They sent it up the second day. (<i>Into telephone.</i>) Hot milk,
please, and let it <i>be</i> hot! (<i>Hanging up telephone. To</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) I expect they were afraid
for their money.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And you paid it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I took the money out of
your pockets and I just paid it. I never said a word. But if you
hadn't been ill I should have said something. Of all the swindles,
of all the barefaced swindles!... Do you see what it's costing you
to live here&mdash;a day?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, not much above four
pounds, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Speechless at
first.</i>) Any woman that knew her business could keep you for a
month&mdash;a month&mdash;for less than you spend here in a
day&mdash;and better. <i>And</i> better! Look here: "Biscuits, 1s.
6d.!"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well (<i>confidentially
earnest.</i>), will you believe me when I tell you there wasn't a
pennyworth of biscuits on that plate? Do you think I don't know
what biscuits are a pound?</p>

<p><!-- Page 78 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_78"
name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.
Really!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Ironically.</i>)
"Cheapest in the end"&mdash;but I should say the end's a long way
off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Who has picked up
another paper, on mantelpiece.</i>) What? "Admit Mr. Albert Shawn
to Westminster Abbey, cloisters entrance.... Funeral....
Tuesday."... That's to-day, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Moved.</i>) But you
told me he wasn't going to be buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You told me Cyrus Carve
had insisted on cremation.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>With vivacity.</i>)
And what did you expect me to tell you? I had to soothe you
somehow; you were just about delirious. I was afraid if I told you
the truth you'd be doing something silly&mdash;seeing the state you
were in. Then it struck me a nice plain cremation at Woking was the
very thing to keep you quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Still more moved.</i>)
Then he's.... Westminster Abbey!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, I should say all is
over by this time. There were thousands of people for the
lying-in-state, it seems.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But it's awful. Absolutely
awful.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Why is it awful?</p>

<!-- Page 79 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_79"
name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I told you&mdash;I
explained the whole thing to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Humouring,
remonstrating.</i>) Mr. Shawn, surely you've got rid of that idea!
You aren't delirious now. You said you were convalescent, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. There'll be a perfect
Hades of a row. I must write to the Dean at once. I
must&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Soothingly.</i>) I
shouldn't if I were you. Why not let things be? No one would
believe that tale&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Do you believe it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Perfunctorily.</i>) Oh
yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, you don't. Honestly,
do you now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.
Well&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Knock at door.</i>) Come in. (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Waiter</span> <i>with hot milk.</i>) Here's
your hot milk.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Waiter</span>. Miss Looe has called.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I must see her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I <i>must</i> see her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh, very well.
(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Waiter</span>.) She's
telephoned each day to inquire how you were. She asked if you
wanted a seat for the funeral. I told her you couldn't possibly go,
but I was sure you'd like to be invited&mdash;whether it was the
Abbey or not. Please don't forget your milk.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. (<i>Coming in quickly,
bowing to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>and shaking
hands with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Good
afternoon. Please don't rise. I've heard how ill you've been. I've
only called because I simply had to.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It's very kind of you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. Oh, Mr. Shawn, I know
you didn't want him to be buried in the Abbey. I'm all for quiet
funerals, too; but really this was an exceptional case, and I think
if you'd seen it you'd have been glad they did decide on the Abbey.
Oh, you've no idea how impressive it was! The Abbey is always so
fine, isn't it? And it was crammed. You never saw such a multitude
of distinguished people. I mean really distinguished&mdash;all in
black, except, of course, the uniforms. Royalties, ambassadors,
representatives from all the academies all over Europe. Rodin was
there!! The whole of artistic London came. I don't mean only
painters, but poets, novelists, sculptors, and musicians. The art
students had a corner to themselves. And you should have seen the
crowds outside. All traffic was stopped up as far as Trafalgar
Square. I've had some difficulty in getting here. The sun was
shining through the stained glass. And <!-- Page 81 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_81" name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>the
music was magnificent. And then when the coffin was carried down
the nave&mdash;well, there was only one wreath on the
pall&mdash;just one&mdash;a white crown. All the other wreaths were
piled near the screen&mdash;scores and scores of them&mdash;the
effect was tremendous. I nearly cried. A lot of people did cry.
(<i>Genuinely moved.</i>) There was that great genius lying there.
He'd never done anything except put paint on canvas, and
yet&mdash;and yet.... Well, it made you feel somehow that England
does care for art after all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>After a pause.</i>)
And whom have we to thank for this beautiful national manifestation
of sympathy with art?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>With an attempt at
cold irony, but yet in a voice imperfectly controlled.</i>) Did
your brother relent and graciously permit Lady Leonard Alcar to
encourage a national funeral? Or was it due solely to the influence
of the newspapers written by people of refined culture like the man
who gave his opinion the other day that I had got 'em? Or perhaps
you yourself settled it with your esteemed uncle over a cup of
tea?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. Of course, Mr. Shawn,
any one can see that you're artistic yourself, and artists are
generally very sarcastic about the British <!-- Page 82 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_82"
name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>public. I know I am.... Now, don't
you paint?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Shrugging his
shoulders.</i>) I used to&mdash;a little.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. I was sure of it. Well,
you can be as sarcastic as you like, but do you know what I was
thinking during the service? I was thinking if only he could have
seen it&mdash;if only Ilam Carve could have seen it&mdash;instead
of lying cold in that coffin under that wreath,
he'd&mdash;(<i>Hesitating.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Interrupting her, in a
different, resolved tone.</i>) Miss Looe, I suppose you're on very
confidential terms with your uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. Naturally. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Will you give him a
message from me. He'll do perhaps better than anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Honoria</span>. With pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Moved.</i>) It is
something important&mdash;very important indeed. In fact&mdash;</p>

no harm in just keeping an eye on it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I see. (<i>Sits

you'd&mdash;</p>

so fast! (<i>Pause. She continues reflectively.</i>) Do you know
what struck me while her ladyship was telling you about all the
grand doings at the funeral&mdash;What good has it ever done
<i>him</i> to be celebrated and make a big splash in the world? Was
he any happier for it? From all I can hear he was always trying to
hide just as if the police were after him. He never had the
slightest notion of comfort, and so you needn't tell me! And
there's another thing&mdash;you <!-- Page 85 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_85"
name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>needn't tell me he wasn't always
worrying about some girl or other, because I know he was. A
bachelor at his age never thinks about anything else&mdash;morning,
noon, and night. It stands to reason&mdash;and they can say what
they like&mdash;I know. And now he's dead&mdash;probably because
he'd no notion of looking after himself, and it's been in all the
papers how wonderful he was, and florists' girls have very likely
sat up half the night making wreaths, and Westminster Abbey was
crowded out with fashionable folk&mdash;and do you know what all
those fashionable folk are thinking about just now&mdash;tea! And
if it isn't tea, it's whisky and soda.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But you mustn't forget
that he was really very successful indeed.... Just look at the
money he made, for instance.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, if sovereigns had
been any use to him he'd never have left two hundred thousand of
them behind him&mdash;him with no family. No, he was no better than
a fool with money. Couldn't even spend it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. He had the supreme
satisfaction of doing what he enjoyed doing better than anybody
else could do it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And what was that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Painting.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Casually.</i>) Oh! and
couldn't he have had that without running about all over
<!-- Page 86 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_86"
name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>Europe? He might just as well have
been a commercial traveller. Take my word for it, Mr. Shawn,
there's nothing like a comfortable home and a quiet life&mdash;and
the less you're in the newspapers the better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Thoughtfully.</i>) Do
you know&mdash;a good deal of what you say applies to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And <i>you</i> now! As
we're on the subject&mdash;before we go any further&mdash;you're a
bachelor of forty-five, same as him. What have you been doing with
yourself lately?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Doing with myself?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I think I ought to
ask because when I was stealing (<i>with a little nervous
laugh</i>) the money out of your pocket to pay that hotel bill, I
came across a lady's photograph. I couldn't help coming across it.
Seeing how things are, I think I ought to ask.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, <i>that</i>! It must
be a photograph of the lady <i>he</i> was engaged to. He broke it
off, you know. That was why we came to London in such a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Then it is true&mdash;what
the newspaper reporter said? (<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>nods.</i>) One of the aristocracy&mdash;(<span

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Lady Alice Rowfant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. What was it doing in your
pocket?</p>

back?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You might come down to see
me one day at Putney.</p>

<p><!-- Page 88 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_88"

I shall be delighted to. But before that, won't you come here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>After a pause.</i>)
I'll try and come the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Why not to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, a couple of days
without me'll do you no harm. It's a mistake to be in a hurry when
you've got all your life in front of you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>After a pause.</i>)
Listen&mdash;have some tea before you go.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No. (<i>Holds out her
hand, smiling.</i>) Good afternoon. Now do go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I haven't <i>begun</i> to
thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No&mdash;and I hope you
won't begin.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You're so sudden.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. It's sudden or
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Holding her hand.</i>)
I say&mdash;what can you see in me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, if it comes to
that&mdash;what can you see in me? (<i>Withdrawing her
hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I&mdash;I don't know what
it is.... Something.... (<i>Lightly.</i>) I dunno! Everything!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. That's too much. Good-bye!
I'll come about this time the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Supposing I have a
relapse?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>At door.</i>) You
won't if you do as I tell you.</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<br />


<p><i>Parlour in Janet's house in Putney. A perfectly ordinary
suburban interior of a small house; but comfortable. Table in
centre. Door</i>, R., <i>up stage, leading to hall. Door</i>, L.,
<i>down stage, leading to kitchen and back premises.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Time</span>.&mdash;<i>Morning in early
autumn. Rather more than two years have elapsed.</i></p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p><i>Discovered</i>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>reading newspaper at breakfast-table.</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>in an apron is hovering busily
near him.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Putting cigarettes and
matches down beside</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Want
anything else, dear? (<i>No answer from</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Because I must set about my
morning's work. (<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>continues
to read.</i>) Albert, are you sure you don't want anything
else?</p>

<!-- Page 91 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_91"
name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>As he still gives her no sign of attention, she snatches the
paper away from him, and throws it on the floor.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Not having moved his
eyes.</i>) The pattern of this jug is really not so bad.... Yes, my
soul?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I've asked you I don't
know how many times whether you want anything else, because I must
set about my morning's work.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Is there any more
coffee?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, plenty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Hot?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Then I don't want any. Got
any bacon?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No, but I can cook a slice
in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>With an affectation of
martyrdom.</i>) Doesn't matter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh yes, I will. (<i>Moving
away.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Drawing her to him by
her apron.</i>) Can't you see he's teasing you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. She's got no time in the
morning for being teased.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>She takes a cigarette, lights it and immediately puts it in
his mouth.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And now you're going to
leave me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Sure you're all right?
(<i>He nods.</i>) Quite sure you're happy?</p>

<!-- Page 92 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_92"
name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Jane&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I wish you wouldn't call
me Jane.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But I will call you Jane.
Jane, why do you ask me if I'm sure I'm happy? When a man has
first-class food and first-class love, together with a genuine
French bed, really waterproof boots, a constant supply of hot water
in the bathroom, enough money to buy cigarettes and sixpenny
editions, the freedom to do what he likes all day and every
day&mdash;and&mdash;let me see, what else&mdash;a complete absence
of domestic servants&mdash;then either that man is happy or he is a
silly cuckoo!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You aren't getting
tired&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. My sweet child, what's the
matter with you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Nothing, nothing. Only
to-day's the second anniversary of our wedding&mdash;and
you've&mdash;you've said nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>After a shocked
paused.</i>) And I forgot it last year, didn't I? I shall be
forgetting my dinner next.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh no, you won't!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And yet all last week I
was thinking about this most important day, and telling myself I
must remember it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Very easy to say that. But
how can you prove it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, it does just happen
that the proof is behind the sideboard.</p>

<!-- Page 93 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_93"
name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. A present?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. A present. It was all
ready and waiting five days ago.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Drawing a framed
picture from behind the sideboard, and trying to hide her
disappointment, but not quite succeeding.</i>) Oh! A picture! Who
is it? (<i>Examines it with her nose close to it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No, no. You can't take a
picture like snuff! Get away from it. (<i>He jumps up, snatches the
picture from her, and exposes it on a chair at the other side of
the room.</i>) Now! (<i>He sits down again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, it doesn't look quite
so queer like that. Those are my cooking sleeves, and that seems a
bit like my kitchen&mdash;that's my best copper pan! Is the young
woman meant to be me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, not to beat about
the bush, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I don't consider it very
flattering.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. How many times have you
told me you hate flattery?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Running to him.</i>)
Now he's hurt. Oh, he's hurt. (<i>Kissing him.</i>) It's a
beautiful picture, and the frame's lovely! And she's so glad he
didn't forget.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It is pretty good. In fact
it's devilish good. It's one of the best things I ever did in my
life. Old Carve would have got eight hundred for that like a
shot.</p>

<p><!-- Page 94 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_94"
name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.
(<i>Sceptically.</i>) Would he? It's wonderful how wonderful people
are when they're dead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And now will she let him
finish reading his paper?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Handing him the paper,
then putting her head close to his and looking at the paper.</i>)
What was it he was reading that made him so deaf he couldn't hear
his wife when she spoke to him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. This.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Reading.</i>) "Ilam
Carve's princely bequest. The International Gallery of Art.
Foundation stone laying. Eloquent speech by Lord Rosebery." Oh! So
they've begun it at last?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes, they've begun it at
last.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, if you ask me, I
should have thought he could have found something better to do with
his money.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. As for example?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I should have
thought there were more than enough picture galleries as it is. Who
wants 'em? Even when they're free, people won't go into them unless
it's a wet day. I've never been in a free picture gallery yet that
wasn't as empty as a church. Stands to reason! It isn't even a
cinematograph. When I see rows of people in Trafalgar Square
waiting to get into the <!-- Page 95 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_95" name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>National Gallery, then I
shall begin to think it's about time we had some more galleries. If
I'd been Ilam Carve&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, what should you have
done, witch?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I should have left a bit
more to you, for one thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I don't want more. If he'd
left me eight hundred a year instead of eighty, I shouldn't be any
happier. That's just what I've learnt since I took lodgings in your
delightful wigwam, Jane&mdash;money and fame have no connection
whatever with happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Money has, when you
haven't got enough.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But I have. You won't hear
of me paying more than half the household expenses, and you say
they're never more than thirty shillings a week. Half
thirty&mdash;fifteen. Look at the balance it leaves me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And supposing I had to ask
you to pay more?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>In a serious
sympathetic tone, startled.</i>) Anything wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, there's nothing
<i>wrong</i>, as it were&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Jane, I do believe you've
been hiding something from me.</p>

<p><!-- Page 96 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_96"
name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.
(<i>With difficulty pulls a letter from her pocket.</i>)
No&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I've felt it for several
days.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You just haven't then.
Because I only got it this morning. Here, you may as well read it.
(<i>Handing him the letter.</i>) It's about the brewery.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Reading.</i>) "Mrs.
Albert Shawn. Sir or Madam."&mdash;Why are shareholders never
supposed to have any particular sex?&mdash;"Sir or Madam. Cohoon's
Brewery, Ltd.,&mdash;I am directed by the shareholders' provisional
committee of investigation to request your attendance at an
informal meeting of shareholders to be held in room 2009 Winchester
House on Friday the 20th inst. at noon. If you cannot be present,
will you kindly write stating whether or not you will be prepared
to support the committee of investigation at the annual meeting. In
view of the probability that the directors' report will be
unfavourable, and the ordinary dividend either passed or much
reduced, the committee wishes to be thoroughly prepared and armed.
Believe me, Sir or Madam." Oh! So that's it, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes. My father said to me
before he died, "Keep the money in beer, Janet"; he said, "Beer'll
never fail in this country." And there you are!</p>

<p>(<i>She goes to fireplace, opens coal scuttle, takes out a piece

keep her hands from being soiled as she replenishes the
fire.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Lightly.</i>) Oh,
well! We must wait and see what happens.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Supposing the dividend
doesn't happen?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I never worry about
money.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. But we shall want to eat
once or twice pretty nearly every day, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Personally, I am quite
satisfied with a plain but perfect table.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You needn't tell me what
you are satisfied with. You're satisfied with the very best at one
shilling and sixpence a pound.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I can place eighty pounds
per annum at your absolute disposal. That alone will pay for over a
thousand best cuts.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, and what about your
clothes and my clothes, and the rates and taxes, and bus-fares, and
holidays, and your cigarettes, and doctor, and errand boys'
Christmas-boxes, and gas, and coal, and repairs? Repairs! A
<i>hundred</i> and eighty is more like what we want.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And yet you have several
times taken your Bible oath that my half-share of it all came to
less than forty pounds.</p>

<!-- Page 98 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_98"
name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well&mdash;er&mdash;I was
thinking of food. (<i>She begins to collect the breakfast
things.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Jane, you have been a
deceitful thing. But never mind. I will draw a veil over this
sinful past. Let us assume that beer goes all to pieces, and that
you never get another cent out of Cohoon's. Well, as you need a
hundred and eighty a year, I will give you a hundred and eighty a
year.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And where shall you get
the extra hundred?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I shall earn it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No, you don't. I won't
have you taking any more situations.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I shall earn it here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. How?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Painting!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Stopping her work and
coming towards him, half-caressing and half-chiding.</i>) I don't
<i>mind</i> this painting business. Don't think I object to it in
the least. There's a strong smell with it now and then, but it does
keep you quiet in the attic while I'm cleaning the house, and
that's something. And then going out making sketches you get
exercise and fresh air. Being with Ilam Carve so long, I expect you
picked up the habit as it were, and I'm sure I don't want you to
drop it. I love to see you enjoying yourself. But you don't suppose
people'll <i>buy</i> these things <!-- Page 99 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_99"
name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>(<i>pointing vaguely to picture on
chair</i>), do you? No; there's far too many amateur artists about
for <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. If I wanted, I could take
a cab and sell that in Bond Street inside sixty minutes at my own
price. Only I don't want.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Now, just listen to me.
You remember that picture you did of Putney Bridge with the saloon
entrance of the Reindeer Public House showing in the corner? It was
one of the first you did here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes, I was looking for it
the other day, and I couldn't find it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I'm not surprised. Because
it's sold.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Sold? (<i>Excited.</i>)
What in the name of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Soothing him.</i>)
Now&mdash;now! Do you remember you said Ilam Carve would have got
&pound;1000 for a thing just like that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. So he would. It was
absolutely characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I said to myself,
"He seems mighty sure of himself. Supposing it's me that's wrong?"
So one day I quietly took that picture round to Bostock's, the
second-hand furniture man, you know,&mdash;he was a friend of
father's,&mdash;and I asked him what he'd give me for it. He
wouldn't take it at any price. Not at any price. Then I asked him
if he'd keep it in his shop and sell it for me
<!-- Page 100 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_100"
name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>on commission. Well, it stuck in
Bostock's shop&mdash;in his window and out of his window&mdash;for
twelve months and more, and then one day the landlord of the
Reindeer saw it and he bought it for six shillings, because his
public-house was in it. He was half-drunk. Mr. Bostock charged me
eighteenpence commission, and I bought you two neckties with the
four and six, and I said nothing because I didn't want your
feelings to be hurt. And that reminds me, last week but one they
took the landlord of the Reindeer off to the lunatic asylum.... So,
you see!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Serious,
preoccupied.</i>) And where's the picture now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I shouldn't be surprised
if it's in the private bar of the Reindeer.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I must get hold of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Albert, you aren't vexed,
are you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Forcing himself to
adopt a light tone.</i>) How could I be vexed with two neckties to
the good? But don't do it again, Jane. I shall go round to the
Reindeer this morning and have a drink. If that picture ever found
its way to a Bond Street expert's, the consequences might be
awkward&mdash;devilish awkward. Because it's dated, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No, I don't see. I
shouldn't have said <!-- Page 101 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_101" name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>a word about it, only
I wanted to save you from being disappointed later on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>In a new casual
tone.</i>) Just get me my cash-box, will you?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>at once produces the
cash-box from a drawer.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And what now? I'm not
broke yet, you great silly. (<i>Laughs, but is rather intimidated
by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve's</span> <i>air.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Having unlocked box
and taken a bag from it.</i>) You see that? (<i>He showers gold out
of it.</i>) Well, count it!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Gracious!
Ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;eighteen&mdash;twenty?&mdash;two&mdash;four&mdash;twenty-six
pounds. These your savings?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. That's what I've earned
with painting, just at odd times.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Really? (<span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>nods.</i>) You could knock me
down with a feather!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I'll tell you. You know
the framemaker's next to Salmon and Gluckstein's. I buy my colours
and canvases and things there. They cost money. I owed the chap two
pounds once, and one morning, in the shop, when I was opening my
box to put some new tubes in, he saw one of my pictures all wet. He
offered of his own accord to take it for what I owed him. I
wouldn't let him have it. <!-- Page 102 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_102" name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>But I was rather hard
up, so I said I'd do him another instead, and I did him one in a
different style and not half as good, and of course he liked it
even better. Since then, I've done him quite a few. It isn't that
I've needed the money; but it's a margin, and colours and frames,
etc. come to a dickens of a lot in a year.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Staggered.</i>) And
whatever does he do with them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. With the pictures? Don't
know. I've never seen one in his window. I haven't been selling him
any lately.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, I didn't feel like it.
And the things were getting too good. But, of course, I can start
again any time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Still staggered.</i>)
Two pounds a piece? (<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>nods.</i>) Would he give you two pounds for that? (<i>Pointing
to portrait.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You bet he would.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Why! Two pounds would keep
us for the best part of a week. How long does it take you to do
one?</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Noise of motor car outside.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh, three or four hours. I
work pretty quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, it's like a fairy
tale. Two <!-- Page 103 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_103"

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. I've been buying some very
delightful little things of yours from a man that calls himself a
picture-dealer and frame-maker (<i>ironically</i>) in the High
Street here. I persuaded him&mdash;not without difficulty&mdash;to
give me your address. And I've ventured to <!-- Page 104 --><span

have anything for sale.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. By chance I haven't!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Nothing at all?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Not a square inch.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Catching sight of
Janet's portrait.</i>) Pardon me. May I look?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh, do!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. A brilliant likeness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Who of?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Why, madam&mdash;yourself?
The attitude is extraordinarily expressive. And if I may say so
(<i>glancing at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>) the
placing of the high lights&mdash;those white sleevelets&mdash;what
d'you call them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Why! Those are my
cooking-sleeves!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Quietly.</i>)
Yes&mdash;well&mdash;it's genius&mdash;mere genius.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Looking at picture
afresh</i>) It <i>is</i> rather pretty when you come to look at
it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. It is a masterpiece, madam.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Then I may not
make an offer for it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. No.</p>

shouldn't the gentleman make an offer for it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Quickly seizing an

pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Five hundred

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Sitting down.</i>) And
if it isn't a rude question&mdash;do you generally go about with
five hundred pounds in your pocket, as it were?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Raising his hands.</i>)
In my business, madam&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It's not for sale.
(<i>Turns it round.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Vivaciously.</i>) Oh
yes, it is. <i>Somebody</i> in this house must think about the
future. (<i>Cajolingly.</i>) If this gentleman can show me five
hundred pounds it's for sale. After all, it's my picture. And you

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Taking the notes.</i>)
Nay, I'm too dizzy to count them. (<i>As if giving up any attempt
to realize the situation.</i>) It fairly beats me! I never

shall....(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>.) Why are
you so interested in my portrait? You've never seen me before.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Madam, your portrait
happens to be one of the very finest modern paintings I ever saw.

Because you painted it. (<i>Pause. He approaches</i> <span

was?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Pointing to Janet's

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes, but you knew before
you saw that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>After
lighting-cigarette.</i>) I did. I knew from the very first picture
I bought from our friend the "picture-dealer and frame-maker" in
the early part of last year.</p>

<p><!-- Page 107 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_107"
name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span><span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. But I'd completely altered my
style. I altered it on purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Shaking his head.</i>)
My dear sir, there was once a well-known man who stood six feet ten
inches high. He shaved off his beard and dyed his hair, and
invented a very ingenious costume, and went to a Fancy Dress Ball
as Tom Thumb. Strange to say, his disguise was penetrated
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. My name is Ebag&mdash;New
Bond Street.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What! You're my old
dealer!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. And I'm delighted at last
to make your acquaintance, sir. It wasn't until I'd bought several
of those small canvases from the Putney man that I began to inquire
closely into their origin. As a general rule it's a mistake for a
dealer to be too curious. But my curiosity got the better of me.
And when I found out that the pictures were being produced week by
week, fresh, then I knew I was on the edge of some mystery.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Awkwardly.</i>) The
fact is, perhaps, I ought to explain.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Pardon me. I ask nothing.
It isn't my affair. I felt certain, solely from the evidence of
what I was buying, that the great painter who was supposed to be
buried in Westminster Abbey, and whose somewhat premature funeral I
attended, must be alive <!-- Page 108 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_108" name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>and painting
vigorously. I wanted the assurance from your lips. I have it. The
rest does not concern me&mdash;at any rate, for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I'll say this&mdash;you
know a picture when you see it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Proudly.</i>) I am an
expert, nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. All right! Well, I'll only
ask you to persevere in your discretion. As you say, it isn't your
affair. Thank goodness, I didn't put a date on any of these things.
I won't sell any more. I'd take an oath never to paint again, only
I know I should go and break it next week. I shall rely on this
famous discretion of yours to say nothing&mdash;nothing
whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. I'm afraid it's too
late.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. How too late?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. I'm afraid I shall have to
ask you to state publicly that you are Ilam Carve, and that there
must have been&mdash;er&mdash;some misapprehension, somewhere, over
that funeral.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Aghast.</i>) Publicly?
Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. It's like this, I've been
selling those pictures to Texel in New York. You remember, he's
always been one of your principal collectors. He's getting old, and
he's half-blind, but he still buys. Now, I rely on my judgment, and
I guaranteed those pictures to <!-- Page 109 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_109" name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>be
genuine Carves. Well, somebody over there must have had
suspicions.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What does that matter?
There isn't a date on any of them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Just so. But in one of
those pictures there's most distinctly a taxi-cab. It isn't a
private motor car. It's a taxi.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And if there is? No law
against painting a taxi, I hope!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Again quietly
dramatic.</i>) No. But at the date of your funeral there wasn't a
single taxi on the streets of London.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. The devil!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Exactly. Texel is bringing
an action against me for misrepresentation. I shall have to ask you
to give evidence and say who you are.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Angrily.</i>) But I
won't give evidence! You've brought this on yourself. How much did
you sell those little pictures for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Oh, an average of between
four and five hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And what did you pay for
them? I ask you, what did you pay for them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Smoothly.</i>) Four
pounds a piece. The fact is&mdash;I did rather well out of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Damned Jew!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Smoothly.</i>)
Damned&mdash;possibly. Jew&mdash;most decidedly. But in this
particular instance I behaved just like a Christian. I
<!-- Page 110 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_110"
name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>paid a little less than I was
asked, and sold for the highest I could get. I am perfectly
innocent, and my reputation is at stake.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I don't care.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. But I do. It's the
reputation of the greatest expert in Europe. And I shall have to
insist on you going into the witness-box.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Horrified.</i>) Me in
the witness-box! Me cross-examined! No. That's always been my
nightmare!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Nevertheless&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Please go.
(<i>Commandingly.</i>) Please go.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Stiffly.</i>) So
<i>you've</i> not been to sleep either?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Stiffly.</i>) Oh yes;
had an excellent night in this chair.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Going to fire.</i>)
Now, you're only boasting. If you've had such an excellent night
(<i>imitating him</i>), who's kept up such an excellent fire?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Lamely.</i>) Well, of
course I looked after it now and then. I didn't want to perish in
my solitude.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Then why didn't you come
to bed, great baby?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Sitting up with
solemnity.</i>) Janet, we are a pair of great babies to have
quarrelled like that,&mdash;especially at bedtime.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Simply.</i>)
Quarrelled?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, didn't we?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. <i>I</i> didn't. I agreed
with everything you said.</p>

<!-- Page 113 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_113"
name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. What did you agree with? I
should like to know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You said I didn't really
believe after all that you are Ilam Carve, and I assured you in the
most soothing manner that I did believe you are Ilam Carve!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And do you call that
agreeing with me? I know perfectly well from your tone that in
spite of all my explanations and reiterations during the last three
months you <i>don't</i> believe I'm Ilam Carve. You only say you do
in order to soothe me. I hate being soothed. You're as convinced as
ever that Ebag is a rascal, and that I've got a bee in my
bonnet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. But what does it
matter?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Cold and hard.</i>)
Well, I like that!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Weeping.</i>) It's not
my fault if I don't believe you're Ilam Carve. I would if I could,
but I can't! You're very cruel.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Jumping up and
embracing her.</i>) Hush, hush! There! (<i>Cajolingly.</i>) Who's
being an infant now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I don't pretend to
understand this art.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I hope you never will. One
of the chief charms of existence in your wigwam, my child, is that
I never hear any confounded chatter about art. Now&mdash;are we
pals?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Smiling
reconciliation.</i>) Darling, do turn the gas up.</p>

class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Obeying, struck by her

<p>(<i>She re-enters immediately with kettle and puts it on

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Going away?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Smiling.</i>) Now do
listen, darling. Let's go away. We can't stop here. This Ebag case
is getting more and more on your nerves, and on mine too. I'm sure
that's what's the matter with us. What it'll be next week when the
trial comes on, I don't know&mdash;upon my soul I don't. It's all
very well for you to refuse to see callers and never go out. But I
can tell you one thing&mdash;we shall have those newspaper people
on the roof in a day or two, and looking down the chimney to see
how I lay the fire. Lawyers are nothing to them. Do you
know&mdash;no you don't, because I didn't want you to be
upset&mdash;last night's milk was brought by a
journalist&mdash;with a camera. They're beginning to bribe the
tradesmen. I tremble to think what <i>will</i> be in this morning's
papers.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Trying to make light
of it.</i>) Oh, nothing will upset me now. But you might let me
know at once if the editor of the <i>Spectator</i> calls round with
the bread.</p>

<p><!-- Page 115 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_115"

That Mr. Horning&mdash;you know the breathless man on the
<i>Evening Courier</i> that came to the Grand Babylon&mdash;he's
taken lodgings opposite&mdash;arrived last night.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. So I thought if we just
vanished&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It's too late&mdash;I've
had the subpoena. If I hooked it, everybody would say I was an
adventurer.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. We could come back for the
trial.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. We should be followed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Not if we start now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, <i>now</i>! The back
door. Before it gets light.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Creep away in the dark!
No! I'll go through with the thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I shall travel
alone, then. Here's my bunch of keys. I'll just explain to you
where everything is. I daresay Mrs. Simpson will come in and clean
up. She's not bad, as charwomen go.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Looking at clock.</i>)
Seven o'clock.</p>

me to?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, what about this

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. There's a train from
Victoria at 8.30.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Very well then. We'll have
another breakfast at Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And the cab?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. We never heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">James</span>. Strange!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. No, it isn't. We took the
bell off three days ago.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">James</span>. I was told that it was
impossible to effect an entrance in the ordinary way. Hence, we had
to use craft. I argued that food must come into the house, and that
it probably came in early.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, it's a good thing

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S</span>. (<i>Not very

<p><span class="smallcaps">James</span>. He is your husband and our

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S</span>. (<i>More positively.</i>)
Yes. And sorry I am to say it. (<span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>eyes her carefully.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">James</span>. I think that suffices.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) Madam, you are in
a most unfortunate position. You supposed yourself to be a married
woman, whereas you are nothing of the kind. I needn't say that as
the victim of a heartless bigamist you have our deepest....</p>

you, and mind the bars. I'll get another cup or two. (<i>Goes to

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And so these are my two
sons! They show little emotion in beholding the author of their
being for the first time. As for me, I hardly recognise them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S</span>. And is it likely, seeing
they were born six months after you deserted me, Albert?</p>

worst. Silly joke about the fertility of curates&mdash;you've met
with it, no doubt!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">James</span>. Your tone is simply
lamentable, sir.</p>

Now, take care; the fire's very hot. (<i>In the same mild tone
to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mrs.</span> <span

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S</span>. Yes. Albert was
twenty-two then, weren't you, Albert?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And how did you come to
find us out at last?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S</span>. It was through an
advertisement put in the paper by that Mr. Texel&mdash;him that's
in this law case&mdash;offering a reward for information about a
Mr. Albert Shawn who'd been valet to that artist man that died.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh! So Mr. Texel has been
advertising, has he? (<i>Giving a cup of tea to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">John</span> <span

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S</span>. Yes, for anybody that
knew Albert Shawn when he was young. "Albert Shawn," I says,
"that's my husband's name." I'd been told he'd gone off in service
with a painter or something of that kind. I married him as a
valet.</p>

all!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. All that rigmarole about
you being Ilam Carve?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. You're beginning to come
round at last?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I think they were
quite honest people&mdash;those three. There's no doubt the poor
creature once had a husband who <i>did</i> run off. And it seems
fairly clear his name was Albert Shawn, and he went away as valet
to an artist. But then, on the other hand, if there is one thing
certain in this world, it is that you were never married before you
married me. That I <i>will</i> swear to.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And yet she identified me.
She was positive.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Positive? That's just what
she wasn't! And didn't you notice the queer way she looked at you
as they went out? As much as to say, "I wonder now whether it
<i>is</i> him&mdash;after all?"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Then you really think she
could be mistaken on such a point?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Pooh! After twenty-six
years. Besides, all men of forty-seven look more or less alike....
And so I'm the wife of Ilam Carve <!-- Page 126 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_126"
name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>that's supposed to be buried in
Westminster Abbey and royalty went to his funeral! We'll have some
tea ourselves. I say, why did you do it? (<i>Pours out
tea.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Casually.</i>) I don't
know. It was to save worry to begin with, and then it went on by
itself and somehow I couldn't stop it.... I don't know!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Endearingly.</i>)
Well, I've always told you frankly you've got a bee in your bonnet.
(<i>Drinking tea and turning over the post.</i>) More letters from
these newspaper people! What's this lovely crest on this
envelope?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. It's from Lord Leonard
Alcar. He says if we'll go up and see him to-morrow afternoon he'll
be very much obliged indeed, and he may be able to be of assistance
to us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Deeply impressed.</i>)
Lord Leonard Al ... Where's the letter? (<i>Searches for it
hurriedly. As she reads it.</i>) Well I never! (<i>Reading</i>)
"And Mrs. Shawn." I've got nothing to go in.</p>

<i>Carve</i>, plain enough.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Did he? A slip&mdash;a
slip! You've brought your husband?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes, but not so easily as
all that. I'm afraid he's quarrelling out there with Mr. Cyrus
Carve. They get across one another on the stairs.</p>

to control so far as possible any expression of your astonishment
at meeting one another here. That is to say, any violent
expression.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I suppose what you really
want is to stop this funny trial from coming on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Slightly taken
aback.</i>) Mrs. X, I congratulate myself on your presence here.
Yes, <!-- Page 133 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_133"
name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>my ambition is to be peacemaker. Of
course a peacemaker always runs the risk of a broken head, but I
shall entrust my head to your good nature. As a proof that I really
mean business, I need only point out that I haven't invited a
single lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>After slight
pause.</i>) This is exceedingly good of your lordship.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. For myself I'm rather
looking forward to next week. I've spared no expense to get up a
first-class show. Half the papers in New York and Chicago are
sending over special correspondents. I've even secured your
champion humorous judge; and altogether I reckon this trial will be
about the greatest judicial proposition the British public's seen
in years. Still, I'm always ready to oblige&mdash;and I'll shake
hands right now, on terms&mdash;my terms.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. We are making
progress.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. But what I don't
understand is&mdash;where <i>you</i> come in, Lord Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Where I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Well, I don't want to be
personal, but is this Hague Conference merely your hobby, or are
you standing in with somebody?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I quite appreciate your
delicacy. Let me assure you that, though it gives me the greatest
pleasure to see you all, I have not <!-- Page 134 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_134"
name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>selected you as the victims of a
hobby. Nor have I anything whatever to gain by stopping the trial.
The reverse. At the trial I should probably have a seat on the
bench next to a delightful actress, and I should enjoy the case
very much indeed. I have no doubt that even now the learned judge
is strenuously preparing his inimitable flashes of humour, and
that, like the rest of the world, I should allow myself to be
convulsed by them. I like to think of four K.C.'s toiling hard for
a miserable hundred guineas a day each. I like to think of the
solicitors, good, honest fellows, striving their best to keep the
costs as low as possible. I even like to think of the jury with
their powerful intellects who, when we are dead and gone, Mr.
Texel, will tell their grandchildren proudly how they decided the
famous case of Texel <i>v.</i> Ebag. Above all, I like to think of
the witnesses revelling in their cross-examination. Nobody will be
more sorry than I to miss this grand spectacle of the greatest
possible number of the greatest possible brains employed for the
greatest possible length of time in settling a question that an
average grocer's assistant could settle in five minutes. I am
human. <i>But</i>, I have been approached&mdash;I have been
flattered by the suggestion&mdash;that I might persuade you two
gentlemen to abandon the <!-- Page 135 --><span class="newpage"><a
id="Page_135" name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>trial, and I may
whisper to you that the abandonment of the trial would afford
satisfaction in&mdash;er&mdash;influential quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Then are we up against the
British Government? Well, go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Protesting with a very
courteous air of extreme astonishment.</i>) My dear Mr. Texel, how
can I have been so clumsy as to convey such an idea? The
Government? Not in the least&mdash;not in the <i>least</i>. On
behalf of nobody whatever. (<i>Confidentially.</i>) I am merely in
a position to inform you positively that an amicable settlement of
the case would be viewed with satisfaction in influential
quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, I can tell you it
would be viewed with satisfaction in a certain street in Putney.
But influential quarters&mdash;what's it got to do with them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I shall be quite frank
with you. The dignity of Westminster Abbey is involved in this
case, and nothing in all England is more sacred to us than
Westminster Abbey. One has only to pronounce the word "the
Abbey"&mdash;to realize that. We know what a modern trial is; we
know what the modern press is; and, unhappily, we know what the
modern bench is. It is impossible to contemplate with equanimity
the prospect of Westminster Abbey and its solemnities being
<!-- Page 136 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_136"
name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>given up to the tender mercy of the
evening papers and a joking judge surrounded by millinery. Such an
exhibition would be unseemly. It would soil our national existence.
In a word, it would have a bad effect.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.
(<i>Meditatively&mdash;bland.</i>) How English! (<i>He gets up and
walks unobtrusively about the room, examining the
pictures.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Undoubtedly. But this is
England. It is perhaps a disadvantage that we are not in Russia nor
in Prussia. But we must make the best of our miserable country.
(<i>In a new tone, showing the orator skilled in changes of
voice.</i>) Can't we discuss our little affair in a friendly way
entirely without prejudice? We are together here, among
gentlemen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I'm afraid you're
forgetting me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Recovering
himself.</i>) Madam, I am convinced that none of us can be more
gentlemanly than yourself.... Can we not find a way of settlement?
(<i>With luxurious enjoyment of the idea.</i>) Imagine the fury of
all those lawyers and journalists when they learn that
we&mdash;er&mdash;if I may so express it&mdash;have done them in
the eye!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. If I wasn't going to come
out on top, I could understand you worrying about your old Abbey.
But I'm taking the part of your Abbey. When I win <i>it</i> wins,
and I'm certain to win.</p>

<!-- Page 137 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_137"
name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I do not
doubt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>With suave
assurance</i>.) But I do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Continuing</i>.) I do
not doubt your conviction, Mr. Texel. It merely proves that you
have never seen a British Jury exercising itself upon a question
relating to the fine arts. If you had you would not be certain, for
you would know that twelve tradesmen so occupied are capable of
accomplishing the most incredible marvels. Supposing you don't
win&mdash;supposing Mr. Ebag wins&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. As I assuredly shall.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Then we should have the
whole world saying, "Well, they haven't given a national funeral to
a really great artist for about a century, and when at last they do
try they only succeed in burying a valet."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Looking round
casually</i>.) England all over!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. The effect would be
lamentable&mdash;utterly lamentable. You will realize that in
influential quarters&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. But do you reckon this
policy of hushing up things ever does any good?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. My dear sir, it is the
corner-stone of England's greatness. It is the policy that has made
her what she is!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Looking round
again</i>.) True! What she <i>is</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Turning sharply to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>behind
<!-- Page 138 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_138"
name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>him</i>.) Mr. X, your interest in
my picture flatters me immensely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Interrupting him</i>.)
I see you've bought my latest portrait of my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Starting up</i>.)
What's that? (<i>She goes to inspect picture</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I suppose it would be
abusing your hospitality to inquire how much you paid our excellent
dealer for it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Not in the least. But the
fact is we haven't yet settled the price. The exact price is to
depend on the result of our gathering.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, if anybody had told
me I should find my own portrait&mdash;cooking-sleeves and
all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<i>Inarticulate&mdash;she returns to her chair</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. And now that we have got
so far, Mr. X, I should like to centralize the attention of this
quite friendly gathering on yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Approaching
airily</i>.) Really! (<i>He sits</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. There are several
questions we might discuss. For example, we might argue the
artistic value of the pictures admittedly the work of Mr. X. That
would probably occupy us for about ten years. Or we might ask
<!-- Page 139 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_139"
name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>ourselves how it happened that that
exceedingly astute dealer, Mr. Ebag, came to sell as a genuine Ilam
Carve, without offering any explanation, a picture which, on the
face of it, was painted some time after that great painter had
received a national funeral in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Sheer carelessness, my
lord.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Or we might ask ourselves
why a valet should try to pass himself off as a world-renowned
artist. Or, on the other hand, why a world-renowned artist should
pass himself off as a valet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Sheer carelessness, my
lord.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. But these details of
psychology are beside the main point. And the main point is
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>)&mdash;Are you Ilam
Carve or are you Albert Shawn? (<i>To the others</i>.) Surely with
a little goodwill and unembarrassed by the assistance of experts,
lawyers, and wigs generally, we can settle that! And once it is
settled the need for a trial ceases. (<span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>assumes an elaborately
uninterested air</i>.) The main point does not seem to interest
you, Mr. X.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Seeming to start</i>.)
I beg your pardon. No, not profoundly. Why should it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Yet you
claim&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Excuse me. I claim nothing
except to be let alone. Certainly I do not ask to be
<!-- Page 140 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_140"
name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>accepted as Ilam Carve. I was
leading a placid and agreeable existence in a place called Putney,
an ideal existence with a pearl among women, when my tranquillity
was disturbed and my life transformed into a perfect nightmare by a
quarrel between a retail trades-man (<i>indicating</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>) and a wholesale ink-dealer
(<i>indicating</i> <span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>) about one
of my pictures. It does not concern me. My role is and will be
passive. If I am forced into the witness-box I shall answer
questions to the worst of my ability, and I shall do no more. I am
not cross. I am not sulking; but I consider that I have a
grievance. If I am here, it is solely because my wife does what she
likes with me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Bravo! This is as good as
the trial.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Good-humouredly</i>.)
Will you answer questions here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Good-humouredly</i>.)
It depends.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Do you assert that you are
Ilam Carve?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I assert nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. <i>Are you</i> Ilam
Carve?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Yes, but I don't want to
be.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Might I inquire why you
allowed your servant to be buried in your name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, he always did
everything for me&mdash;a most useful man.... But I didn't 'allow'
him to be buried in my name. On the <!-- Page 141 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_141"
name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>contrary, I told various people
that I was not dead&mdash;but strange to say, nobody would believe
me. My handsome, fascinating cousin here wouldn't even let me begin
to tell him. Even my wife wouldn't believe me, so I gave it up.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">
<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Texel</span> <i>does not conceal his

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Grimly</i>.) Which

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. But do you
mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. May I interrupt, Lord
Leonard? I could listen for hours to this absolutely stupendous
gentleman. A circus is nothing to it. But aren't we jumping the
track? I've got two witnesses. Mr. Cyrus Carve will swear that your
Mr. X is <i>not</i> his cousin. And the original Mrs. Albert Shawn
will swear that he <i>is</i> her husband. That's my case. How is my
esteemed opponent going to answer it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. In the first place, have
you cross-examined this very original Mrs. Albert Shawn?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Come. You don't mean to
argue that a woman could mistake another man for her own
husband&mdash;even after twenty-five years or so?</p>

<!-- Page 142 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_142"
name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Smiling apologetically
for his freedom</i>.) According to the divorce reports, they're
constantly doing it after one year, to say nothing of
twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. (<i>Appreciative</i>.)
Good! That's good! Well, I may tell you right here that I had an
interview with this gentleman's (<i>indicating</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>) ecclesiastical twins only yesterday
afternoon, and they assure me that their mother is positive on the
point.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Meditatively</i>.)
Simpletons!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I beg pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I daresay they preach very
nicely, but out of the pulpit they don't what I should call shine,
poor boys! Anybody could see she wasn't positive. Why, it wasn't
until the old lady dropped in to have a cup of tea with us that I
felt sure my husband's name really <i>was</i> Carve.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Then you hadn't credited
his story before?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Well, it wanted some
crediting, didn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>With intention</i>.)
You only began to credit it after Mr. Ebag had called and paid you
the sum of &pound;500 in cash.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>After a slight pause,
calmly</i>.) Oh! So you know about that, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>, <i>genially</i>.) Cousin, if you
continue in that strain I shall have to take <!-- Page 143 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_143"
name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>you out on to the doormat and
assault you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. I should like to
say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Interrupting
grimly</i>.) Lord Leonard, isn't it time that this ceased?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. (<i>Heartily amused</i>.)
But why? I'm enjoying every minute of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I should be sorry to
interfere with Mr. Texel's amusement, but I think the moment has
now come for me to make a disclosure. When I was approached as to
this affair I consulted Mr. Cyrus Carve first, he being the sole
surviving relative of his cousin. That seemed to me to be the
natural and proper course to adopt. Mr. Cyrus Carve gave me a very
important piece of information, and it is solely on the strength of
that information that I have invited you all to come here this
afternoon. (<i>He looks at</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Clearing his throat,
to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Of course, you'll argue that after
thirty-five years absence it's a wise man that can recognize his
own cousin. I'm absolutely convinced in my own mind that you
(<i>scorn-fully to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>) are
not my cousin. But then, you'll tell me that men have been hung
before now on the strength of sworn identification that proved
afterwards to be mistaken. I admit it. I admit that in theory I may
be <!-- Page 144 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_144"
name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>wrong. (<i>With increased grim
sarcasm.</i>) I admit that in theory the original Mrs. Shawn may be
wrong. Everything's possible, especially with a bully of a K.C.
cross-examining you, and a judge turning you into 'copy' for
<i>Punch</i>. But I've got something up my sleeve that will settle
the whole affair instantly, to the absolute satisfaction of both
plaintiff and defendant.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. My dear fellow, why not
have told us this exciting news earlier?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Why not? (<i>Glowering
at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Because I wanted you
to commit yourself completely beyond any withdrawing. I decided
what sort of man you were the moment I first set eyes on you, and
when I heard of this law case, I said to myself that I'd come
forward as a witness, but I shouldn't give any evidence away in
advance. I said to myself I'd show you up once and for all in full
court. However, his lordship prevailed on me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. When my cousin and I were
boys I've seen him with his shirt off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. True. And he's seen you
with <i>yours</i> off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Now just here (<i>pointing
to left front neck below collar</i>), just below his collar, my
cousin Ilam Carve had two moles close together&mdash;one
<!-- Page 145 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_145"
name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>was hairy and the other wasn't. My
cousin was very proud of them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Ferociously
sarcastic.</i>) I suppose you'll say you've had them removed?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Casually.</i>) No. Not
precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Can you show them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Very casually.</i>) Of
course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. (<i>Slapping his
knee.</i>) Great! Great!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Staggered but
obstinate.</i>) Well, let's have a look at them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) Then doubtless you are familiar
with this double phenomenon, Mrs. X?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Yes. But he isn't so proud
of his moles now as he used to be when he was a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Now, gentlemen, you see
how beautifully clear the situation is. By one simple act we shall
arrive at a definite and final result, and we shall have avoided
all the noise and scandal of a public trial. Mr. X, will you oblige
us very much by taking your collar off?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Jumping up.</i>)
Please, there's just one little thing. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Wait a moment, dear. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>.) Mr. Ebag, how many of those
pictures did you sell to Mr. Texel?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Fifteen.</p>

<!-- Page 146 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_146"
name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. And you made a profit of
over four hundred pounds on each?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>.
(<i>Boisterously&mdash;laughing to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>.) You did?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Fifteen times four
hundred&mdash;that makes&mdash;how much does it make?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Six thousand, madam.
Thirty thousand dollars. Great!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>.) Don't you think we deserve some of
that, as it were?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. Madam, I shall be delighted
to pay you five thousand four hundred pounds. That will be
equivalent to charging you a nominal commission of ten per
cent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I won't touch a penny of
their wretched money.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Sweetly.</i>) I
wouldn't dream of asking you to, dearest. <i>I</i> shall touch it.
Goodness knows what street we shall be in after this
affair&mdash;and with my brewery shares gone simply all to pieces!
Now, dearest, you can take it off. (<i>She resumes her
seat.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Lightly.</i>) I'm
hanged if I do!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. But, my dear Mr. X!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Lightly.</i>) I'm
dashed if I take my collar off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Triumphant.</i>) Ha! I
knew it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Why should I offer my skin
to the inspection of two individuals in whom I
<!-- Page 147 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_147"
name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>haven't the slightest interest?
They've quarrelled about me, but is that a reason why I should
undress myself? Let me say again, I've no desire whatever to prove
that I am Ilam Carve.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. But surely to oblige us
immensely, Mr. X, you will consent to give just one extra
performance of an operation which, in fact, you accomplish three
hundred and sixty-five times every year without any disastrous
results.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. I don't look at it like
that. Already my fellow-citizens, expressing their conviction that
I was a great artist, have buried me in Westminster Abbey&mdash;not
<i>because</i> I was a great artist, but because I left a couple of
hundred thousand pounds for a public object. And now my
fellow-citizens, here assembled, want me to convince them that I am
a great artist by taking my collar off. I won't do it. I simply
will not do it. It's too English. If any person wishes to be
convinced that I'm an artist and not a mountebank, let him look at
my work (<i>pointing vaguely to a picture</i>), because that's all
the proof that I mean to offer. If he is blind or shortsighted I
regret it, but my neck isn't going to help him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Brilliant! Then we shall
have the trial after all.</p>

<!-- Page 148 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_148"
name='Page_148'>[148]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. Yes, but your brilliant
friend will be on his way to South America before then.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Sweetly to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>.) I assure you it's quite true about
those moles. That's why he wears those collars.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Grimly.</i>) No
doubt.... (<i>Repeating.</i>) Nevertheless he'll be on his way to
South America.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Gaily.</i>) Or
Timbuctoo.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. (<i>Significantly.</i>)
Unless you're stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. And who's going to stop
me? All the laws of this country added together can't make me take
my collar off if I don't want to.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. What about arresting you
for bigamy? What about Holloway? I fancy at Holloway they have a
short method with people who won't take their collars off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. Well, that will only be
another proof that the name of this island is England. It will be
telegraphed to the Continent that in order to prove to herself that
she possessed a great artist, England had to arrest him for bigamy
and shove him into prison.... Characteristic! Characteristic!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Who has moved across
to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) Mrs. X, can
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Rising to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>, <i>winningly.</i>) Now&mdash;Ilam.
You're only laying up trouble for yourself, and for me too. Do
please think of the trial. You know how shy you are, and how
<!-- Page 149 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_149"
name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>you tremble at the mere thought of
a witness-box.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cyrus</span>. I can believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Smiling at</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) I've got past shyness. I think it
was the visit of my fine stalwart sons yesterday that cured me of
shyness. I doubt if I shall ever be shy any more.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Appealingly.</i>)
Dearest, to please me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Curt now for the first
time, with a flash of resentment.</i>) No.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>After a slight pause;
hurt and startled; with absolute conviction, to</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Lord Leonard Alcar</span>.) It's no use. He's
made up his mind.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. I have an idea that I can
persuade&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Hotly.</i>) Excuse me.
You can't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. I have an idea I can. But
(<i>hesitates</i>) the fact is, not in the presence of ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Oh. If that's
all&mdash;(<i>walks away in a huff.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) My deepest apologies.</p>

<div class="smalldiv">

<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>out.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Texel</span>. Well, well! What now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) You remember Lady Alice
Rowfant?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>Taken aback.</i>) That
doesn't concern you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ebag</span>. (<i>Ignoring this
answer.</i>) Pardon me if I <!-- Page 150 --><span
class="newpage"><a id="Page_150"
name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>speak plainly. You were once
engaged to marry Lady Alice Rowfant. But a few days before your
valet died you changed your mind and left her in the lurch in
Spain. Lady Alice Rowfant is now in England. She has been served
with a subpoena to give evidence at the trial. And if the trial
comes on she will have to identify you and tell her story in court.
(<i>Pause.</i>) Are you going to put her to this humiliation?</p>

his necktie.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lord Leonard Alcar</span>

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Under emotion, to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Then you've done it! (<span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>ignores her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Yes, and <i>I</i> feel
like a dentist.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. You've sent them all
away.</p>

<!-- Page 151 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_151"
name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I thought you'd like me
to. Mr. Ebag took charge of Mr. Texel. Your cousin Cyrus was
extremely upset.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Who say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Lady Alice Rowfant, of
course. Oh! You needn't pretend! As soon as Mr. Ebag asked me to go
out I knew he'd got her up his sleeve. (<i>Weeps slightly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. (<i>Very
sympathetically.</i>) My dear young lady, what is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Her utterance
disturbed by sobs&mdash;indicating</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) He'd do it for her, but he
wouldn't do it for me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. I assure you, Lady Alice
Rowfant has not been here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. Honest?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. No. The mere mention of
her name was sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. That's even worse!
(<i>Rushing across to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>
<i>and pettishly seizing his necktie.</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span> <i>submits.</i>) Here! Let me do
it&mdash;for goodness sake! Great clumsy! (<i>Still
tearful&mdash;to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lord Leonard
Alcar</span> <i>as she ties the necktie.</i>) Somehow I don't mind
crying in front of you, because you're so nice and fatherly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Well, if I'm so fatherly,
may I venture on a little advice to you two? (<i>To</i> <span
class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) You said you didn't want to be
Ilam Carve. <!-- Page 152 --><span class="newpage"><a id="Page_152"
name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span><i>Don't</i> be Ilam Carve. Let
Ilam Carve continue his theoretical repose in the Abbey and you
continue to be somebody else. It will save a vast amount of
trouble, and nobody will be a penny the worse. Leave
England&mdash;unobtrusively. If you feel homesick, arrange to come
back during a general election, and you will be absolutely
unnoticed. You have money. If you need more, I can dispose of as
many new pictures as you like to send.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I don't want him to paint
any more pictures.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. But he will.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. I suppose he will. Why is
it? As if we hadn't had enough bother already through this art
business!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Alcar</span>. Yes. But artists are like
that, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>. (<i>Affectionately
reproachful to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>.) Child!
Look how nicely I've tied it for you. (<i>Shakes him.</i>) Whatever
are you dreaming about?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carve</span>. (<i>After glancing in
mirror reflectively.</i>) There's only one question. Last time they
buried me in the Abbey,&mdash;what will they do with me next
time?</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
